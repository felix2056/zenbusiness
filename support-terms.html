<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin">6. SERVICE FEES AND BILLING METHODS</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md">ZenBusiness charges you for service fees and state filing fees. The state filing fees pass directly to the state and subject to change pending state requirements. ZenBusiness may collect these fees directly using a third-party payment service. ZenBusiness may place a $100.00 hold on your payment method until the full-service fees and filing fees are determined. ZenBusiness will charge you the fees from your applicable State associated with forming a business and filing documents with a State and for such other Services as you select while using the Site. If you do not pay on the billing date, you can correct your credit card information and pay the outstanding amounts before the one-month anniversary of your billing date. If you have not made any payments on your Subscription by the one-month anniversary of your billing date, ZenBusiness may suspend your service and terminate your Subscription. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your charge is returned for any reason, including through a chargeback, ZenBusiness may, at&nbsp; its sole and absolute discretion, suspend or terminate your access and account, which will terminate these Terms and our obligations under them. If a charge made to your credit card is declined, ZenBusiness may make up to five attempts to bill that card over a thirty-day period. If you wish to reactivate your account after a termination, there will be no setup or reactivation fees. However, if your account was terminated for nonpayment, it will be reactivated only after ZenBusiness receives the full amount past due.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>ZenBusiness Money.</strong> You agree to pay the applicable fees listed on our Fee Schedule (“Fees”) for use of the Payment Services. All Fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from transferred or collected funds and thereafter from the Balance in your ZenBusiness Money Account. You also grant us Recovery Authorizations (as defined herein), which we may utilize to recover fees you owe us. We reserve the right to change the Fees upon reasonable advance notice. All Balances and all Fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Payment Services are denominated in U.S. dollars.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>One-Time Payments.&nbsp;</strong>ZenBusiness offers services that are subject to a one-time fee. These services include filing for an EIN on your business’ behalf, requesting priority handling of the&nbsp; formation of your business with the State, and other services that may be offered by ZenBusiness from time to time. The one-time service payments are not subject to the automatic renewal or recurring payment schedule referenced in this section and are payable at the time of your request.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Notice of Automatic Billing.</strong>&nbsp;I understand that ZenBusiness may send a reminder email to the email address of record for my account before my installment billing dates. I acknowledge and agree that this notice is provided as a courtesy only, and ZenBusiness is not obligated or required to provide such notice. I acknowledge and agree that (i) my failure to read, (ii) my inability to receive, and/or (iii) the failure of ZenBusinss to send the email does not create any liability on the part of ZenBusiness or any third-party service provider.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Abandoned or Incomplete Orders.&nbsp;</strong>I understand that, other than as required by applicable law, I shall have no right to cancel, request a cash refund or obtain store credit for any undelivered order after 120 days have elapsed from the purchase date unless ZenBusiness is at fault. Itemization of fees is displayed for convenience only. Abandoned orders may result in liquidated damages equal to the amount paid to ZenBusiness for reimbursement of our commitment to service this order.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Recurring Payments.</strong>&nbsp;ZenBusiness also offers paid services for an initial period of 12 months. The paid services are billed to you using a recurring payment system that recurs and is billed on either a monthly or yearly basis.&nbsp;You authorize ZenBusiness to charge the card originally used for purchase on either the monthly or yearly anniversary of your engagement of the services, as appropriate. If you have purchased the Worry Free Compliance service, you will also be billed for State compliance event filing fees at the time of any compliance event (e.g. Annual Reports). If a payment fails or is expired, you will be notified by ZenBusiness and access to the Services will be suspended until payment is received. You may elect to discontinue some or all of your paid services at any time by contacting support@zenbusiness.com. Should you elect to discontinue any of the paid services prior to the expiration of the initial 12-month term you may be required to pay a cancellation fee and any other expenses which have been paid or incurred by ZenBusiness, including state or third-party vendor fees.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong>&nbsp;Your subscription will be automatically renewed each month or year on the corresponding date you began using the Services and the payment method on file with ZenBusiness will be charged each month or year unless you notify ZenBusiness and terminate the services in accordance with this section. <strong>BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OF USE&nbsp; YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICES (1) YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICES WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD; (2) YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE BILLED AT THE START OF EACH NEW SUBSCRIPTION PLAN PERIOD; AND (3) THAT PERIODIC CHANGES FOR EACH NEW SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY BILLED TO YOUR DESIGNATED BILLING PAYMENT METHOD.

Once the subscription ends, ZenBusiness will stop providing the related services for your entity and/or account, and you understand that you are personally responsible for updating all necessary information with the Secretary of State and any other agencies or stakeholders. You can opt back into automatic renewal of a subscription at any time, provided the subscription has not already terminated.</p>

If your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the customer, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales. You can process a refund through your ZenBusiness Money Account up to 120 days from the day you accepted the payment. If your available ZenBusiness Money Account Balance is insufficient to cover the refund, we may exercise any of our rights set forth in this Term of Use, including withdrawing up to the requested refund amount (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from a payment instrument registered with your ZenBusiness Money Account including any Reserve, and crediting it back into your customer’s Card. The Fees also are refunded by ZenBusiness Money, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your customer. ZenBusiness Money has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Right of Setoff and Security Interest. </strong>You hereby grant us a security interest in, as well as a right of setoff against, and assign, convey, deliver, pledge and transfer to us, as security for repayment of any obligations due under these Payment Terms and any other agreement you have with us, all of your right, title, and interest in and to all of your accounts with us.

You are liable for any of our costs associated with collection in addition to any amounts owed, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Dormant ZenBusiness Money Accounts.</strong> If you do not process payments through your ZenBusiness Money Account for an extended period of time or have not linked a valid bank account, you may have a Balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under your state’s law, as applicable.

If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your ZenBusiness Money Account.

If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by us for the collection of all amounts unpaid by you.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Excessive Chargebacks. </strong>If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish additional conditions governing your ZenBusiness Money Account, including (a) establishing new processing fees; (b) creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees; (c) delaying payouts, or (d) terminating or suspending the Payment Services.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Contesting Chargebacks.</strong> You will assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Payment Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the customer, the customer’s financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback.

You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin">20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md">Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with ZenBusiness and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. </em>All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by ZenBusiness that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and ZenBusiness, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</em> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to ZenBusiness should be sent to: 5511 Parkcrest Dr., Suite 103, Austin, TX 78731, Attention: Dispute Resolution. After the Notice is received, you and ZenBusiness may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and ZenBusiness do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Arbitration Rules.</em> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that ZenBusiness made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, ZenBusiness will pay you the greater of the award or $1,000.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</em> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Time Limits.</em> If you or ZenBusiness pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Authority of Arbitrator.</em> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and ZenBusiness, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and ZenBusiness.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Waiver of Jury Trial. </em>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and ZenBusiness in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. </em>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Confidentiality.</em> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Severability.</em> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Right to Waive.</em> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Survival of Agreement.</em> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with ZenBusiness.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Small Claims Court.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or ZenBusiness may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><em>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Travis County, Texas, for such purpose.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin">21. NOTICE</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin">23. GOVERNING LAW; VENUE</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md">This Agreement and the relationship between you and ZenBusiness will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, notwithstanding the choice of law provisions of the venue where any action is brought, where the violation occurred, where you may be located or any other jurisdiction. Subject to the Arbitration provision above, you agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas and waive any defense of lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue or forum non conveniens to a claim brought in such court, except that ZenBusiness may elect, in its sole discretion, to litigate the action in the county or state where any breach by you occurred or where you can be found. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out or related to your use of the Service or this Agreement shall be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or will forever be barred. </p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>SUMMARY:&nbsp;</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md">MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE AT (844) 493-6249 or VIA EMAIL AT SUPPORT@ZENBUSINESS.COM. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE WITH CLIENT OR CLIENT’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S) TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF CLIENT AND/OR CLIENT’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S) HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND CLIENT AND/OR CLIENT’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT.&nbsp; ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS.&nbsp; ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.&nbsp; ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.&nbsp; WE WILL PAY ALL COSTS OF ARBITRATION, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND CLIENT AND/OR CLIENT’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM EACH OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU AND THEY WOULD BE IN COURT.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Arbitration Agreement:</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>(B) ARBITRATION </strong>– You, on the one hand, and ZenBusiness, on the other, agree that any claim or dispute (“Claim”) between us shall, at the election of any one of us, be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules for consumer arbitrations. It is the parties’ intent that this arbitration provision be construed broadly, including that this arbitration agreement include any Claims by you against ZenBusiness as well as their respective corporate affiliates for claims arising out of this Agreement directly related to the services or product/service websites.&nbsp; However, any disputes or claims you may have which relate to your credit report, or any claims arising out of or relating to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and/or the FCRA’s state law equivalent(s), are not subject to or governed by this agreement to arbitrate.&nbsp; You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and ZenBusiness are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. At your request, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of your arbitration filing fee.&nbsp; (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.&nbsp; If you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly after receiving a written request).&nbsp; The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual Claim. YOU, ON ONE HAND, AND ZENBUSINESS, ON THE OTHER, AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and ZenBusiness agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s Claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision in the preceding sentence is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision in this Section [_] shall be null and void. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, any party may bring an individual action in small claims court.&nbsp; The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”).&nbsp; Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall follow substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA and shall honor any claims or privileges recognized by law.&nbsp; The terms of this Section [_] shall survive any termination, cancellation or expiration of this Agreement.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">*Following the Effective Date of this Agreement, ZenBusiness agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace the bracketed phrase with the following language for new or modified Terms of Use: “Further, unless You, on one hand, and Client and/or Client’s service provider(s), on the other,”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>LIABILITY</strong> – NEITHER ZENBUSINESS, CSID, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU AS AN AGENT IN OBTAINING COPIES OF: YOUR PERSONAL CREDIT REPORT, CREDIT ALERT REPORT, QUARTERLY UPDATE, OR CREDIT SCORE.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin">3. <strong>SCORE DISCLOSURES</strong></h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>VANTAGESCORE 3.0 CREDIT SCORE</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md">VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, Experian®, TransUnion®, and Equifax®. VantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you’ll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Credit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day. Different credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers. Your lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don’t be surprised if your lender gives you a score that’s different from your VantageScore. (And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores). Just remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not. For some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lender’s score. If the lender’s score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p>
