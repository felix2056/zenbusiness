<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>You’ll first need to</strong><a href="how-to-name-your-llc.html"><strong> </strong><strong>name your New York LLC</strong></a><strong>.</strong> You’ve more than likely already given this some thought. Keep in mind that your LLC’s name can have big implications.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">While you can always change a business name in the future, it’s best to pick one that will fit for years. You’ll want to pick a name that’s easy to remember and resonates with your customers.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Official Naming Requirements for New York LLCs</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">New York State has laws for naming an LLC that you can find on the Department of State’s website. Here’s a rundown of what to know according to New York Limited Liability Company Law § 204. We’ll be highlighting points that may be considered most important:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The LLC’s name must be distinguishable from other LLCs, corporations, and limited partnerships (LPs) already on file with the New York Department of State.</li>



<li>The LLC’s name must also be distinguishable from domestic and foreign LLCs, corporations, or LPs on file with the Department of State’s Division of Corporations.</li>



<li>The LLC’s name must contain one of the following words/abbreviations:<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Limited Liability Company</li>



<li>LLC</li>



<li>L.L.C.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The LLC’s name cannot contain certain restricted and prohibited words, which can be found on the Department of State’s website as well.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">After you’ve chosen a name, make sure it isn’t taken. You can do this by using our New York business entity search tool. If everything looks good and the name you’ve chosen is available, you’ll next want to reserve it while you get your LLC set up.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Reserving a business name for your New York LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can reserve your LLC’s name with the state. New York gives you the option to reserve a name by submitting an Application for Reservation of Name. It places a 60-day hold on your intended name, preventing any other entities from using it to register their businesses.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Remember that reserving a name doesn’t mean New York has approved your LLC’s name request. It only prevents other limited liability company registrants from using your intended name when they submit their LLC forms.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We encourage you to reserve your New York LLC name with us. We’ll hold your name for 120 days.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Reserving a domain name for your LLC in New York</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">This is also the perfect time to think about how your business name will translate on the internet. A domain name is your website address and can be used for your company email address, too.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll want your domain name to be as close to your New York limited liability company’s name as possible to easily identify yourself.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Check if your domain name is available</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can conduct a domain name search to see if the one you want is available. Once you’ve chosen a name, take advantage of our services to easily register your domain name.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Is your New York LLC name available as a web domain?</strong></h3>


<p class="txt-body-md">When thinking of the perfect name for your LLC, you should also check if it’s available as a domain name. If it is, grab it as soon as you can. A domain that shares your business’s name adds an additional marketing advantage.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">A business website can reach additional customers outside of your city or even the state if you plan to offer your goods and services online in addition to your brick-and-mortar location. Take advantage of our domain name search tool to see if the business name you want is available as a URL.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Our domain name service can help you find and purchase a name for your LLC. In addition to all of this, we can also help you build a business website and provide domain name privacy. Once you get your business website up and running, you can reach a new group of customers online and promote the site through social media.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Getting a “doing business as” (DBA) name for your New York LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once your New York LLC is registered with the state, you can do business under that name. However, if you plan to do business under a variation of that name or an entirely different name, you’ll need to file a Certificate of Assumed Name with the state.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">An “assumed name,” also known as a New York DBA name, can be filed in New York for a fee or you can let us file it for you. The state recommends that the assumed name document be completed under the guidance of an attorney.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Getting a trademark for your New York LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Another thing to consider is trademarking your limited liability company’s name in New York. Although trademarking isn’t required, it can add an extra level of protection that prevents other businesses from using your name.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Trademarks can be registered at the state and federal level:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>To register a trademark at the state level, reach out to the New York State Department’s Division of Corporations and State Records at (518) 474-4770.</li>



<li>To register a trademark at the federal level, you can visit the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">You should also conduct a trademark search to make sure the name you want isn’t already trademarked.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Appoint a registered agent for your New York LLC.</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href="registered-agent.html">registered agent</a>&nbsp;is a person or business that receives important legal documents like service of process (lawsuits) on&nbsp;<a href="new-york-registered-agent.html">behalf of your LLC</a>.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In New York, the Secretary of State acts as the registered agent for every New York LLC by default. This is required by state law. However, you can add an additional registered agent in your Articles of Organization.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-who-can-be-a-new-york-registered-agent">Who can be a New York registered agent?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">New York state law (NY LLCL § 302) says that if you’re appointing a registered agent, the agent must be:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>A resident of New York or with a business address in New York.</li>



<li>A New York&nbsp;<a href="incorporate.html">corporation</a>&nbsp;or LLC.</li>

<p class="txt-body-md">If you’d much rather be your own registered agent, you can, but there are some things to consider.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-availability">Availability</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">A registered agent should be available at their principal address during normal business hours. This makes it difficult to leave the office to run errands, meet up with potential clients, etc.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-avoiding-embarrassment">Avoiding Embarrassment</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If a lawsuit is filed against your business, you could have papers served to you at your office in front of clients. Obviously, that could be bad for business.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin">D<strong>o I need to keep the New York Secretary of State as my registered agent?</strong></h3>


<p class="txt-body-md">In accordance with New York law, the Secretary of State is named as an LLC’s registered agent by default. However, if you’d like, you can name an additional one in your Articles of Organization. You can even name yourself as your LLC’s registered agent but this responsibility may be best for someone else.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If your registered agent ever has to change their address, they’ll need to file a ​​Certificate of Change of Address of Registered Agent in accordance with Chapter 4, Article 8, Section 805-A of the state’s Business Corporation Law. This is for domestic companies.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>File your Articles of Organization with the New York Department of State’s Division of Corporations, State Records, and Uniform Commercial Code.</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Now that you’ve selected a name, you need to register your New York LLC. Filing your New York Articles of Organization certificate legally forms your LLC in New York. It provides the government with vital information about your business for the state’s records. The certificate acts as proof that your LLC was formed and exists as a business entity.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Filing official government documents like this can be confusing, which is why we’re here. With our <a href="pricing-business-filing.html">business filing service options</a>, we can handle the filing for you to make sure it’s done quickly and correctly the first time.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Create a NY.gov account to file Articles of Organization</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can file your Articles of Organization online, and many would argue it’s easier and faster. In order to do this, you’ll need to create a NY.gov account on New York’s Business Express website and pay a $200 fee. If you’d prefer to do so via mail, that option is also available.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Information needed for your New York Articles of Organization</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In order to complete the Articles of Organization for your New York limited liability company, you’ll need to include the following information:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Your New York LLC’s name.</li>



<li>The county where the LLC will be located. The county <strong>must be in the state of New York</strong>.</li>



<li>Your designation for service of process (registered agent). Remember that the New York Secretary of State is your registered agent by dault. If you want your own, list that person/entity in your Articles of Organization.</li>



<li>Your name, both as a signature and in print.</li>



<li>The filer’s information. This includes name and address. The Department of State will issue a filing receipt.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Check out the state of New York’s official page for forming a limited liability company for more information.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Member-Managed or Manager-Managed?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In New York, you have the option to make your LLC either <a href="member-managed-vs-manager-managed-llc.html">member-managed or manager-managed</a>. New York LLCs are automatically member-managed unless otherwise stated in their Articles of Organization in accordance with New York Limited Liability Company Law Chapter 34, Article 4, Section 401.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">A member-managed LLC simply means that the members participate in the operation and management of the company. In a manager-managed LLC, the decision-making authority is granted to a manager. This person or persons may or may not be members of the LLC.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">It’s best to discuss this topic with a business attorney for a clearer understanding of how it works.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">How to expedite your New York LLC’s Articles of Organization</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The average processing time in New York for an LLC’s Articles of Organization is typically seven business days. However, you can expedite this service for an additional fee with the Division of Corporations. The fee will depend on the processing time needed:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>$25 per document for processing within 24 hours.</li>



<li>$75 per document for same-day processing.</li>



<li>$150 per document for processing within two hours.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Payments must be made by check to the Department of State. Handling fees for expedited service are not required for online filing.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>When does my LLC’s formation become effective?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In accordance with New York LLC Law Chapter 34, Article 2, Section 203, an LLC is officially formed at the time that its Articles of Organization are filed with the Department of State or any later time specified in the Articles not exceeding 60 days from the date they were filed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The state recognizes the Articles of Organization to be “conclusive evidence of the formation of the limited liability company as of the time of filing or effective date if later, except in an action or special proceeding brought by the attorney general.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Some LLC owners opt to delay their filing date in order to save money and time on specific responsibilities like taxes and filing their annual report (biennial report in New York). If they don’t need or want their company formed right away, some entrepreneurs select a future filing date in order to save time and money on annual reports and tax filings by waiting until January 1 of the coming year. This is to avoid having to file taxes on the LLC in the current calendar year.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We offer a delayed filing service that’s quite simple to use. You’ll get the option of delaying your LLC’s effective date for an extra fee. Note that this service is only available from October to January.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Monitor your business documents</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you have us handle filing your Articles of Organization, once the state approves your LLC, your paperwork will be available from your ZenBusiness dashboard where you can keep it and other important paperwork digitally organized.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you get your physical paperwork back from the state approving your new LLC, you’ll want to keep it in a safe location along with your other important documents, such as your operating agreement, member certificates, contracts, compliance checklists, transfer ledger, etc.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Draft an operating agreement to detail how your New York LLC will be organized and run.</strong> A New York LLC operating agreement (OA) is a legally binding document that all members of an LLC agree on and sign.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">According to New York’s LLC law, your LLC operating agreement can be entered into by members before, at the time of, or within 90 days of your Articles of Organization being filed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This agreement outlines the rules, regulations, and procedures of your business operations. New York is one of the few states that legally require an OA to be drafted for an LLC.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>The benefits of having a New York LLC operating agreement</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If dealing with more paperwork sounds like a chore, then consider a few benefits of having an OA:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Not having one can result in legal troubles since they’re required by law in the state (Section 417 of the state’s LLC law).</li>



<li>It establishes how your New York limited liability company will be run.</li>



<li>It can aid in your LLC’s limited liability status according to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).</li>



<li>It can help settle business disputes between the LLC’s members.</li>



<li>It makes your company look more legitimate, making it easier to get funding through loans. Financial institutions often require an OA when applying for a loan or opening a business bank account.</li>



<li>It can supersede New York’s default laws concerning LLCs.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What to include in your New York LLC operating agreement</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’re wondering what to include in the OA for your New York LLC, you can start with the following:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Any member limitations</li>



<li>Each member’s rights and responsibilities</li>



<li>Each member’s initial investment in the company</li>



<li>Distribution of profits</li>



<li>Voting rules for members</li>



<li>Succession plans should a member leave, die, retire, etc.</li>



<li>What events may cause the dissolution of the LLC</li>



<li>How to handle dissolving the LLC</li>



<li>How to amend the OA</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">You should also know that if you plan to dissolve the LLC, you’ll need to file Articles of Dissolution with the Department of State for a fee of $60.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>✓&nbsp;</strong>If you want to create an operating agreement but aren’t sure how to get started, then<strong> check out <a href="operating-agreement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline">this guide</span>.</a> </strong>Make note that, if you decide to form your LLC with ZenBusiness, <strong>all our plans include a customizable operating agreement template</strong> to save you time researching and crafting the agreement yourself<strong>.</strong></p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Do I need an operating agreement if I’m the only owner?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you happen to be the only owner of the LLC, you may think that an OA isn’t needed because, as the single owner, no one else will participate in the company’s operation. However, even if you’re the only owner, by law in New York, you still need to have an OA in place.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Along with the benefits mentioned above about having an OA, as a single member, you can lay out what’s to happen to the LLC if you die or become incapacitated and are the only member. You can grant ownership of the company to someone else or have it dissolved upon your death or incapacitation.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) to register your LLC with the federal government. </strong>You’ll have to do this with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). An EIN is also known as a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) and Federal Tax Identification Number.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">An EIN is like a Social Security number for your business. Every New York LLC with employees or more than one member will need this nine-digit number. An EIN is required for tax purposes and financial paperwork, including filing New York state taxes, hiring new employees, and opening company bank accounts.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can get your New York LLC’s EIN through the IRS website, by mail, or by fax. If you’d like to make things easier for yourself, you can use our EIN service.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Register for New York State sales tax</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If your business will be conducting sales that are subject to sales tax, then you’ll have to register with the New York Tax Department to obtain a Certificate of Authority. This certificate allows you to collect tax on these taxable sales. You can find more information on the state’s Department of Taxation and Finance website.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Can filing as an S corp lower my taxes?</strong></h3>


<p class="txt-body-md">The LLC model is one of the more popular ones due to its flexibility and tax benefits. LLCs are taxed as sole proprietorships if there’s only one member or as partnerships if there are multiple members. This can be an appealing feature because it avoids “double taxation.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Double taxation involves paying taxes once at the business level and then again when income is paid to the company owners. LLCs can opt to be taxed as an S corporation (Subchapter S Corporation). Your LLC will still have pass-through taxation, and it can also offer the advantage of saving you money on self-employment taxes.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This allows you to be an “employee-owner.” You can split your income into your share of the company’s profits along with your salary. Doing this allows you to pay self-employment taxes on your salary but not your profits.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Two caveats of opting for an S corp status for your LLC are that this status is very difficult to get and you’ll catch some extra attention from the IRS who has a tendency to scrutinize S corps closely.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can find more tax-related information about New York S corporations on the state’s Department of Taxation and Finance website. As always, we encourage you to reach out to a tax professional for more information about how LLCs and S corporations are taxed.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Open a business bank account with your EIN</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you’ve secured an EIN, you’ll be able to open a business bank account. It’s critical to separate your business and personal accounts since it sorts your finances come tax season. Using a single account for business and personal purposes can complicate your taxes and make it more difficult to differentiate yourself from your business.</p>

Meet the New York LLC Publication Requirement</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Lastly, you’ll need to meet the state’s publication requirement for LLCs.</strong> Once you’ve successfully filed your Articles of Organization, New York LLCs are required to publish a notice about the LLC’s formation within 120 days of the LLC’s effective date.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The notice must be published once each week for six consecutive weeks in two separate newspapers (one with daily circulation and one with weekly circulation). Newspaper designations are determined by the county clerk. The notice should include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The name of LLC Name</li>



<li>The date you filed your LLC’s Articles of Organization</li>



<li>The LLC formation date (if different from the date you filed the Articles of Organization)</li>



<li>The New York county where the LLC’s office is located</li>



<li>A statement that the LLC designated the Secretary of State as an agent to receive service of process for the LLC</li>



<li>The name and address of the LLC’s registered agent</li>



<li>A statement that the LLC’s registered agent can receive service of process for the LLC</li>



<li>The nature of the LLC’s business</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">After the final run of the publication notice, each newspaper will provide an Affidavit of Publication which will need to be included with the Certificate of Publication. The Certificate of Publication needs to be submitted with the appropriate state filing fees to the Department of State for its review. Once approved, the Certificate of Publication package is returned with the state’s stamp of approval.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>New York LLC Formation Notice Publication Costs</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Costs typically range from $600-$1200 when you combine the New York county fees, newspaper advertising rates, and certificate filing fees.</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">No double taxation. With an LLC, you’ll only pay personal taxes instead of personal and corporate taxes, as you would with a traditional corporation.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Flexible operations. An LLC isn’t required to have a board of directors and annual meetings.&nbsp;</span></li>

<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">This person must then pay federal income taxes based on that. This is in contrast to most corporations, whose profits are taxed at the corporate level and again when they’re distributed to the individual shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Single-member LLCs assume the tax status of a disregarded entity, while multi-member LLCs assume the partnership’s tax status.

<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing to know about New York is that it imposes an annual filing fee for single-member and multi-member LLCs.

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Any LLC treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes may have to file a corporate franchise tax return with New York State.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">An LLC may have to pay a filing fee on behalf of specific members. The same goes for an estimated income tax in New York.&nbsp;</span></li>
