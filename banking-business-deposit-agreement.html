<ol class="txt-body-md">
<li>How to Contact Us</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You may contact us with any questions or concerns regarding your Account, including to access your statements and transaction history. All communication between you and us will be handled by ZenBusiness.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The best way to contact us is through email at <a href="mailto:support@zenbusiness.com">support@zenbusiness.com</a>.&nbsp; You may also contact us by Phone at 1(844) 493-6249, Monday–Friday, 8am–8pm CST and Sunday from 10am–7pm CST.

<ol start="2" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Type of Account and Eligibility</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">The Account is a non-interest-bearing non-consumer demand deposit account used to hold your business deposits and make certain types of payments and transfers. When we receive the funds that you deposit to your Account, the funds will be held and accounted for so as to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), subject to applicable limitations and restrictions of such insurance.&nbsp; To open an Account, you must be a Business Entity incorporated in the United States. Other eligibility requirements may apply. This Account may only be used for business purposes and cannot be used for any personal, family or household purposes.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may set such eligibility criteria or decline to open an Account for any reason permitted by law and at our sole discretion.&nbsp; We are not liable for any Losses (as defined below) resulting from refusal of an Account relationship. We may also limit the number of Accounts that you have in our sole discretion. Your Account is subject to security and fraud prevention restrictions at any time, with or without notice.</p>


<ol start="3" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Online or Mobile Access To Your Account</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">When you open an Account, you may also be enrolled in an online business banking service or mobile application (collectively, “Online Banking Services”) offered by ZenBusiness that you can use to access your Account, view information about your Account and conduct certain transactions. You may also be given access to various features through the Online Banking Services separate from your Account. If you cancel your enrollment in the Online Banking Services at any time, we may close your Account as detailed below.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Online Banking Services and its features are governed by the ZenBusiness Terms of Service and other agreements, as well as the ZenBusiness Privacy Policy, which may be provided to you separately or made available through ZenBusiness’s website, https://www.zenbusiness.com. Please review these documents carefully because by using the Online Banking Services, you agree to be bound by them. These services are not provided or controlled by the Bank or this Agreement.</p>


<ol start="4" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Paperless Account</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">To open an Account, you must agree to go “paperless.” This means that you must (a) provide us with and continue to maintain a valid email address and (b) accept electronic delivery of all communications that we need or decide to send you in connection with your Account by agreeing to the ZenBusiness E-SIGN NOTICE &amp; CONSENT at <a href="banking-esign.html">https://www.zenbusiness.com/banking-esign/</a>.</p>

<li>How To Open an Account</li>

<p class="txt-body-md">You may open an Account by visiting ZenBusiness’s website at <a href="index.html">https://www.zenbusiness.com</a> and following the instructions there.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Each person completing the Account opening process or otherwise completing any Account opening requirements represents and warrants that he, she or they:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Are authorized to execute all documents or otherwise complete our requirements in his, her or their stated capacity;</li>
</ul>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Have furnished all documents or other information necessary to demonstrate that authority;</li>

<li>Will furnish other documents and complete other requirements as we may request him, her, or them;</li>

<li>he, she, or they have read this Agreement and agree to be bound by and comply with its terms.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may refuse to recognize any resolution or document affecting the Account that appears to us to be incomplete, improperly executed, or fraudulent.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Important information about procedures for opening a new Account:</strong> To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information identifying each person who opens an Account. This means that when you open an Account, we will ask for information that allows us to identify you, including your name, legal address, date of birth, Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We also may ask for a driver’s license or other identifying documents for your business, account owners, and your officers, directors, beneficial owners, controlling shareholders and others.</p>


<ol start="6" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Minimum Deposits and Balances</li>

<p class="txt-body-md">We may allow you to give another person (known as an “attorney-in-fact”) power of attorney to act on your behalf for your Account. You must obtain written approval from us before we will honor any power of attorney. Email us at the email address specified above for approval if you plan to create a power of attorney. Please be aware that it may take up to two (2) weeks for us to review your request. If approved, we will honor orders and instructions from your attorney-in-fact until (a) we receive a written revocation from you; (b) we are notified that you or your attorney-in-fact have died or become incapacitated; or (c) we terminate our acceptance of the power of attorney. We may terminate our acceptance at any time, for any reason and without notice to you, and you will not hold us liable for any Losses (as defined below) that may result from such action.</p>


<ol start="9" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Death or Incapacitation</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You agree that if we receive notification or if we have reason to believe that you or any Authorized User has died or become legally incapacitated, we may place a hold on your Account and refuse all transactions until we know and have verified the identify of your heir, devisee or successor. Until we received notice and any required proof of death or incapacitation, we may continue to accept deposits and process transactions to your Account. Your estate will be responsible for repaying us for any tax liability resulting from payment of your account balance to your estate. You will hold us harmless for any actions we take based on our reasonable belief that you have died or become incapacitated. If certain payments originating from government entities are deposited into your Account after your death, we may be required to return those payments to the originator upon notice.</p>

You acknowledge that we, in our sole discretion, may use such third-party service providers to fulfill any of our obligations under this agreement, including by performing functions that you have otherwise authorized us to perform, such as processing transactions, handing account operations including account set-up, transaction monitoring, and customer support, and providing technological connection to ZenBusiness and the Bank.&nbsp; Each of these third-party service providers may in turn use their own third-party service providers, at our discretion.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may also share your information with other service providers that we believe need the information to perform a technology, business, or other professional function for us such as IT services, maintenance and hosting of our services, marketing partners, accounting, auditing, and tax services, and other professional services.</p>

<ol start="2" class="txt-body-md">

</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">It is important that you keep track of your transactions and the funds in your Account that are available for you to use (“Available Balance”) by reviewing your transaction history.

<p class="txt-body-md">You are also responsible for reviewing your Account statements as they are made available to you for errors or unauthorized activity. If you identify an error or unauthorized activity, you must notify us promptly to avoid losing your money. Please refer to the applicable sections below for information concerning errors and unauthorized activity.</p>


<ol start="3" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Protect Your Account Information</li>

Keep your Account number, debit card, and statements secure at all times, and be careful about who you share this information with. If ZenBusiness provides you with access to Online Banking Services, make sure to also keep your computer or mobile device secure at all times and avoid accessing the Online Banking Services when others can see your screen.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If your Account number, debit card, mobile device or Online Banking Services login credentials are lost or stolen, notify us immediately to keep your losses to a minimum. Please refer below for information and applicable deadlines for notifying us of losses or theft.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">Credit given by us with respect to an ACH credit entry is provisional until we receive final settlement for such entry through a Federal Reserve Bank. If we do not receive final settlement, you acknowledge and agree that we are entitled to a refund of the amount credited to you in connection with the ACH credit entry, and the party making payment to you via such entry will not be deemed to have paid you in the amount of such entry.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Under the operating rules (the “Rules”) of the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”), which are applicable to ACH transactions involving your Account, we are not required to give next day notice to you of receipt of an ACH item and will not do so. However, we will continue to notify you of the receipt of ACH items through your Account statements.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may accept on your behalf payments to your Account which have been transmitted through one or more automated clearing houses and which are not subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and your rights and obligations with respect to such payments will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement that the law of some other state will govern.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">If a deposit or transfer to your Account is returned or rejected by the paying financial institution for any reason, or if there is an error or mistake involving a deposit or transfer, we may deduct the amount of the deposit, transfer, or error without prior notice to you.

<li>Transfers To or From Connected Bank Accounts</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You may be provided with the ability to link another bank account you have with another financial institution (“connected bank account”) to your Account with us to make inbound and outbound ACH transfers between the connected bank account and your Account through the Online Banking Services. An “inbound transfer” moves funds into your Account from a connected bank account. An “outbound transfer” moves funds from your Account to a connected bank account. We will facilitate transfers to a connected bank account separate and apart from any access we provide you to the ACH Origination Service (see below).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For inbound transfers, we will debit your connected bank account and credit your Account with us on the next business day after you initiate the transfer. The funds you transfer to your Account will be made available to you by the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) business day after the funds have been credited to your Account.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For outbound transfers, we will debit your Account with us and credit your connected bank account on the next business day after you initiate the transfer. The financial institution that holds your connected bank account determines when those funds will be made available to you in your connected bank account.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The cut-off time for both inbound and outbound transfers is 3:00 PM ET. Transfer requests that you make on a business day before the cut-off time will be considered initiated on that day. Transfer requests that you make after the cut-off time, or on a day that is not a business day, will be considered initiated the following business day that we are open.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">There are limits to the dollar amount of both inbound and outbound transfers you can make. Please see the relevant sections on withdrawal and deposit limits above.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You agree that you will only attempt to link a bank account for which you have the authority to transfer funds. You may only link a bank account that is a deposit account, such as a checking, savings or money market account.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">You must not use your Account for any illegal purposes or, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal, for online gambling of any sort, including any betting transaction, purchase of lottery tickets, casino chips, or off-track betting and wagering. We may deny any transaction or refuse to accept any deposit that we believe is related to illegal activity, online gambling or for any other reason at our discretion.&nbsp; However, in the event that a charge or transaction described in this section is approved and processed, you will still be liable for the charges.</p>


<ol start="9" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Funds Transfer Services</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Funds transfers to or from your Account will be governed by the rules of the funds transfer system(s) through which the transfers are made (“system rules”), including Fedwire, the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”). We are under no obligation to honor, in whole or in part, any payment order or other instruction that could result in our contravention of applicable law, including requirements of the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”).&nbsp; For additional information on electronic fund transfers generally, see below.&nbsp; For additional information on (1) ACH transactions specifically and (2) check deposits and mobile deposit services, and (3) wire transfers, see the relevant titled sections below. &nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If your Account receives incoming ACH transactions (either credits or debits) or wire transfers initiated from within or outside of the United States, both you and we are subject to the Operating Rules and Guidelines of NACHA, or the rules of any wire transfer system involved, and the laws enforced by OFAC. Under such rules and laws, we may temporarily suspend processing of a transaction for greater scrutiny or verification against the OFAC list of blocked parties, which may result in delayed settlement, posting and/or availability of funds.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We reserve the right to temporarily suspend, block or reject the processing of any transaction, to freeze or block certain funds or the full balance of any Account, account owner, account beneficiary, or Authorized User (each, a “Restricted Person”), in each case to the extent we deem reasonably necessary to comply with any notice, order, regulation, rule, requirement or restriction issued or promulgated by OFAC (collectively, the “OFAC Rules”).&nbsp; To comply with OFAC Rules, we may temporarily suspend processing of a transaction or the availability of a balance for greater scrutiny or verification against the OFAC list of blocked parties, which may result in delayed settlement, posting and/or availability of funds.&nbsp; If we determine there is a violation or potential violation of the OFAC Rules, or if we cannot satisfactorily resolve a suspected or potential violation, we may reject such transaction or freeze or block the subject funds or full balance of any Account or Restricted Person. If we block the subject funds and you believe you have adequate grounds to seek the return of any blocked funds, it is your sole responsibility to pursue the matter with the appropriate governmental authorities. Please see the OFAC website for procedures and form required to seek a release of blocked funds.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You also will observe all anti-money laundering and exchange control laws and regulations, including economic and trade sanctions promulgated by OFAC, in relation to any funds transfer, and you will use all reasonable efforts to assist us to do likewise. You warrant that the information given to us by you is accurate. We may disclose any information given to us that we in our sole discretion think necessary or desirable to disclose; except we will only disclose confidential information if required by law, a court, or legal, regulatory, or governmental authority, or as permitted by law to combat, prevent, or investigate issues arising under anti-money laundering laws, economic sanctions, or criminal law.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Sometimes legal, regulatory, or governmental authorities require additional information, either with respect to individuals, entities, or particular transactions. You warrant that you will promptly supply all such information, which any such authority may require, and/or which we may be required to supply, in relation to the individual, entity, or particular transaction.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you, or your Authorized User, breach any such laws or regulations, you irrevocably agree that we may retain any monies or funds transmitted to us pursuant to this Agreement and/or not fulfill any funds transfer request if we are required to take or refrain from such action by any legal, regulatory, or governmental authority or if we reasonably believe that such action may violate any laws or regulations described herein, and such monies will not bear interest against us.

<li>How We Post Transactions To Your Account and Determine Your Available Balance</li>
</ol>


<ol class="txt-body-md">
<li>Posting Overview</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">To understand how we post transactions to your Account, it is important to first understand the difference between your Available Balance and your ledger balance. Your Available Balance is the amount of money you have in your Account at any given time that is available for you to use. Your ledger balance is the balance in your Account at the beginning of the day after we have posted all transactions to your Account from the day before. We use your Available Balance to authorize your transactions throughout the day and determine whether you have sufficient funds to pay your transactions. Here are some additional terms that are helpful to understand:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Credit and debit – A credit increases your balance and a debit decreases your balance.</li>



<li>Post or posted – Transactions that are paid from or deposited to your Account. Posted transactions will either increase or decrease both your Available Balance and your ledger balance.</li>



<li>Pending – Transactions that we receive notice of and are scheduled to post to your Account. Pending transactions affect your Available Balance, but not your ledger balance.</li>



<li>Card authorization and settlement – When you use a debit card to make a purchase, the transaction occurs in two steps: card authorization and settlement. Card authorizations reduce your Available Balance, but not your ledger balance. Settlement reduces both your Available Balance and your ledger balance. Card authorizations are removed when settlement occurs or after a certain number of days have passed, whichever is sooner. Please see below for more information about card authorizations and settlement.</li>
</ul>


<ol start="2" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Posting Order</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">We receive transactions throughout the day and post them to your Account as they are received and in the order that they are received. Note that for debit card transactions, we consider the transaction received when the merchant requests settlement, which may occur several days after you authorize the transaction. See below for additional information concerning how debit card transactions are processed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may change the order in which we post transactions to your Account at our discretion and without notice to you. It is therefore important for you to keep track of the deposits you make and the transactions you authorize to make sure there are sufficient funds in your Account to cover all transactions and any applicable fees.</p>


<ol start="3" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Determining Your Available Balance</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">To determine your Available Balance, we start with your ledger balance at the beginning of the business day, add any pending credits or deposits that we make available to you, and subtract any card authorizations and pending debits. All transactions are debited or credited from your Available Balance in the order received.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your balance is accessible through the Online Banking Services or by contacting us as indicated above. Keep in mind that your Available Balance may not reflect every transaction you have initiated or previously authorized. For example, your Available Balance may not include transactions you have authorized that we have not received.</p>


<ol start="4" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Debit Card Authorizations</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you are issued a debit card with your Account, you will be able to use your card to pay for goods or services or conduct other transactions with a merchant. When you engage in a transaction with a merchant using your debit card, the merchant will request preauthorization (“card authorization”) for the transaction. If there are sufficient available funds in your Account, we will approve the request and reduce your Available Balance for as long as the card authorization remains on your Account.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your Available Balance will generally be reduced by the amount of the card authorization. If you use your card at a restaurant, your Available Balance may be reduced by the amount of the card authorization plus up to an additional twenty percent (20%) of that amount, to account for potential tipping.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The card authorization will remain on your Account until the merchant sends us the final amount of the transaction and requests payment (“settlement”). In most cases, If the merchant does not request settlement, or the merchant is delayed in requesting settlement, the card authorization will automatically be removed after three (3) days. However, for certain merchants such as hotels and rental car companies, it may take up to thirty (30) days for the card authorization to be removed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">It is important to understand that the merchant controls the timing of card authorizations or settlement. A merchant may request settlement after the card authorization has been removed from your Account. This means that if you use the funds in your Account after the card authorization has been removed and the merchant later requests settlement, your Account may become overdrawn. A merchant may also request settlement for an amount that is different than the card authorization. Therefore, it is important that you keep track of your transactions and your balance. Once we have approved a card authorization, we cannot stop the transaction and you will be responsible for repaying any negative balance that may occur.</p>


<ol start="11" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Statements</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Statements will periodically be provided to you by through the Online Banking Services, via the ZenBusiness mobile app, as long as your Account is not inactive. You will receive a statement monthly as long as you have transactions on your Account during the statement period. If there were no transactions on your Account, we may not provide you with statements or may provide you with statements on a less frequent basis. You will not receive paper statements.</p>


<ol start="12" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Errors On Your Account and Limitations of Liability</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You will carefully review your statements for your Account and all cards and will promptly report to us any errors or unauthorized activity by email at the address indicated above within thirty (30) days after we make the statement available to you. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or required by law, if you do not provide us with timely notice of an error or unauthorized activity, we will deem our records concerning your Account and all cards to be correct and we will not be liable to you for any Loss you suffer relating to the error or unauthorized activity. You further agree that we may debit or credit your Account at any time and without notice to you to correct an error or address unauthorized activity.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Please refer to the relevant section below for additional information concerning errors and unauthorized transactions involving electronic fund transfers and related limitations of liability.</p>


<ol start="13" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Overdrafts, Nonsufficient Funds and Negative Balances</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">We do not permit you to overdraw your Account. If the Available Balance in your Account is not sufficient to cover any transaction you have authorized, we may return the transaction or refuse to process the transaction. However, there may be instances where your Account can still go into the negative, such as if a deposit you make is returned. You must make a deposit immediately to cover any negative balance. If your Account has a negative balance for sixty (60) calendar days or more, we may close your Account.</p>


<ol start="14" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Closing Your Account and Account Suspensions</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can close your Account at any time and for any reason by email at the contact provided above. We reserve the right to refuse your request if you have a negative balance on your Account. We recommend that you transfer or withdraw any funds you may have in the Account prior to submitting a request to close the Account to avoid delays in receiving your funds.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may also suspend or close your Account, or suspend, or disable any service or feature of your Account, at our discretion with or without notice. This includes if we believe you are using your Account for fraudulent or illegal purposes or in violation of law or regulation, this Agreement, any other agreement you may have with us or Unit, if multiple transactions are returned on your Account, or if you otherwise present undue risk to us or our third-party service providers.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Accounts with a zero balance will continue to be charged any applicable fees until you request to close your Account. We may close an Account with a zero balance on the fee period ending date or at month end without prior notification to you. Once an Account is closed (either by you or us), no fees will be assessed on the Account.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may also close your Account if you have not made any deposits or withdrawals from your Account in over twelve (12) months. In addition, canceling your enrollment in the Online Banking Services with ZenBusiness will result in our closure of the Account and our return of your funds.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If your Account is closed with a balance greater than $1.00, we will return any funds you may have in the Account to you by ACH transfer to another bank account or by paper check. We reserve the right not to return the funds to you if the balance in your Account is $1.00 or less.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We are not responsible to you for any damages you may suffer as a result of the closure or suspension of your Account. The closure of your Account or termination of this Agreement does not impact any right or obligation that arose prior to closure or termination, or any right or obligation that, by its nature, should survive termination (including all indemnifications obligation by you, our limitations of liability, and all terms governing arbitration).</p>


<ol start="15" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Dormancy, Inactivity and Unclaimed Property</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">State law and our policy govern when your Account is considered dormant. Your Account is usually considered dormant if you have not accessed your Account, communicated to us about your Account or otherwise shown an interest in your Account within the period of time specified under applicable law. Each state has varying laws as to when an account becomes dormant, and we may be required to send the balance in your Account if it becomes dormant to the state of your last known address. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you if required by applicable law before transferring the remaining balance of your Account to the applicable state. After we surrender the funds to the state, you must apply to the appropriate state agency to reclaim your funds. You can avoid the surrender of your funds by simply conducting transactions, contacting us about your Account or replying to any abandoned property notices we may provide to you.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may also place your Account in an inactive status if you have not had any transaction for at least six (6) months. If your Account becomes inactive, you may not receive statements or be able to conduct certain transactions. Inactive Accounts must be reactivated. Contact us by email to reactivate your Account.</p>


<ol start="16" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Account Fees and Fee Schedule</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You will pay all fees and charges applicable to your Account. All fee amounts will be withdrawn from your Account and will be assessed regardless of whether you have sufficient funds in your Account, except where prohibited by law. Fees are subject to change at any time. We will provide you advance notice of any changes where required by law.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">Your Account allows you to withdraw funds up to the Available Balance or make deposits through electronic fund transfers (“EFTs”). EFTs are transactions that are processed by electronic means and include, among others, ACH transfers, debit card transactions and direct deposits. This Section provides you with information and important disclosures and terms about the EFTs that are permitted on your Account. You may also receive additional services through Online Banking Services provided by ZenBusiness, that allow you to initiate EFTs to and from your Account that are not described in this Agreement.

<ol class="txt-body-md">
<li>Description of ACH Origination Service</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">The ACH Origination Service allows you to instruct us to create and/or send a NACHA formatted file on your behalf to execute the transfer of funds to/from another financial institution to disburse/concentrate funds or to make payments/collect funds to/from another party via the system. All transactions executed through the ACH Origination Service described above will be collectively known as (“ACH transactions”). The ACH Origination Service is only accessible through the Online Banking Services. Your use of and access to the ACH Origination Service is separate and apart from your ability to facilitate transfers via ACH to a connected bank account.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We will facilitate only Internet-Initiated/Mobile Entry (“WEB”) and Corporate Credit or Debit Entry (“CCD”) ACH transactions through the ACH Origination Service. We will select, at our sole discretion, whether to facilitate any given ACH transaction as a WEB transaction or CCD transaction.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms that appear in this section will have the meanings set forth in the Rules of NACHA.</p>


<ol start="2" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Processing Deadlines</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Except as provided in Security Procedures in below, we will (a) process entries received from you to conform with the file specifications set forth in the Rules, (b) transmit such entries as an Originating Depository Financial Institution to the Federal Reserve Bank, and (c) settle for such entries to the specified accounts as provided in the Rules.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We will transmit such entries to the Federal Reserve Bank by the deadline of the ACH one (1) business day prior to the effective entry date shown in such entries, provided (i) such entries are received 3:00 PM ET on a business day, (ii) the effective entry date is at least two (2) days after such business day, and (iii) the Federal Reserve is open for business on such business day. A “business day” is a day in which the Federal Reserve Bank is opened to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business, other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If any of the requirements of clause (i), (ii), or (iii) listed above are not met, we will use reasonable efforts to transmit such entries to the Federal Reserve Bank by the next deposit deadline on which the Federal Reserve is open for business.</p>


<ol start="3" class="txt-body-md">
<li>ACH Rules</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">When engaging in any transaction through the ACH Origination Service, you will comply with the Rules.

You agree to comply with and be bound by the Rules. In the event you violate any of the applicable Rules and NACHA imposes a fine on us because of your violation, we may charge the fine to you. We agree to inform you of revisions to the Rules of which we have knowledge. Our current process does not support the origination of IAT’s (international ACH transactions).</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">As defined in the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (“Check 21”), a “check” is a draft, payable on demand and drawn on or payable through or at an office of a bank, whether or not negotiable, that is handled for forward collection or return, including substitute checks (see below) and travelers checks.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can only deposit checks into the Account using the mobile check deposit services (the “Check Deposit Services,” as further described herein) and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">Federal rules for Check 21 allow banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks,” as defined in Check 21.&nbsp; Below are the details and your rights related to substitute checks.</p>


<ol class="txt-body-md">
<li>Substitute Checks</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">To make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks.” These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Some or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other law with respect to those transactions.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">   2. Mobile Check Deposit Services</p>

</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your Account may support receiving and/or initiating domestic wire transfers. Refer to the relevant sections above to determine whether you will be able to receive wires, initiate wires, or both. We may make use of correspondents, agents, subagents, and funds transfer and communication systems.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may select any means for the transmission of funds that we consider suitable. We may make use of correspondents, agents, subagents, and funds transfer and communication systems.

<ol start="2" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations on Wire Transfers</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">There are limitations on the frequency and amount of transactions you can make to or from your Account. These limits are different for each type of transaction. For limits that apply to transactions that credit or deposit funds into your Account, please refer to the section above concerning deposits. For limits that apply to transactions that debit or withdraw from your Account, please refer to the section above concerning withdrawals. There may be limits on the beneficiaries who can receive a wire transfer you initiate from your Account. These security-related limits may change from time to time.</p>


<ol start="3" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut-Off Times for Wire Transfers</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">We have cut-off hours for processing wire transfers. If a wire request is received by 4:00 PM ET on a business day and verified through our security procedures outlined in the section below titled “Security Procedures,” funds will be processed the same business day. If it is received after 4:00 PM ET or on a non-business day and verified through our security procedures, funds may be processed the next business day.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We may treat any wire transfer request received at or after our cut-off time as if it was received that business day, or we may treat it as if it were received at the opening of the next business day.</p>


<ol start="4" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Security Procedures</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You agree and consent to the use of certain security procedures by us to confirm the validity of the wire transfer request made pursuant to this Agreement. You understand the security procedures are not designed to detect errors in the content of the wire transfer request or to prevent duplicate transfers. Some elements of the procedures will vary, depending upon the method used to initiate a wire transfer. You hereby agree that your utilization of any security procedure established hereunder will constitute your agreement to its use and affirmative acknowledgment of its commercial reasonableness.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You further agree that any wire transfer request that is acted upon in good faith by us in compliance with these security procedures, whether in fact authorized by you, will constitute an authorized wire transfer.</p>


<ol start="5" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Liability for Incorrect Wire Transfers</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You are responsible for providing us with the accurate name and account number for wire transfers, and we are responsible for transmitting money to the account number you provided.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">When you provide us with a name and account number for us to process a wire transfer, we may make payment solely on the basis of the account number, even if the account number identifies a person different from the beneficiary so named. We or an intermediary bank may send a wire transfer to an intermediary bank or beneficiary’s/designated recipient’s bank based solely on the bank identifying number, even if the payment order indicates a different name. You should be very careful when providing the account number for a wire transfer.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you have provided us with the wrong account number, there may be no way to correct the error or retrieve the funds. You agree that you will pay the amount of a wire transfer even in such circumstances. You are responsible for all Losses resulting from an incorrect account number or your misidentification of the beneficiary/designated recipient.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you think a wire transfer is wrong or if you need more information about a wire transfer, you must contact us by email at the address provided above as soon as possible and no later than fourteen (14) days after you receive your monthly statement. If you do not tell us about an error, we will not have any obligation to pay interest on the amount of an unauthorized or erroneous wire transfer for which we are liable, and you will also be liable to us for all Losses we may incur.</p>


<ol start="6" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You must pay us the amount of the wire transfer, plus any applicable fees, before we will execute the wire transfer request. Please see the applicable section of Agreement above for fees applicable to wire transfers.</p>


<ol start="7" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Execution of Wire Transfers</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">A wire transfer request is considered accepted by us when we execute it. Please refer to the section above concerning cut-off times for more details. You can verify whether your wire transfer request has been executed by contacting us using one of the methods specified above.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We have no responsibility to accept any incoming wire transfer(s) for your benefit. Likewise, we have a right to reject any wire transfer request(s) for an outgoing wire transfer for reasons including insufficient or uncollected funds in the account specified in the wire transfer request, a request that fails any required security procedures, our inability to execute the wire transfer for the reasons set out in the section of this agreement entitled method used to make the wire transfer above, or if we are unable to verify the authenticity of the wire transfer request. If we stop a domestic outgoing wire transfer, we will refund the fee.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If we determine, in our sole discretion, not to honor, execute, or accept a wire transfer request, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you. We will also make reasonable efforts to notify you promptly if a wire transfer is returned to us after its execution. In either case, we will have no liability by reason of our delay or failure to provide you with notice, and we will have no obligation to resend a wire transfer if we complied with the original wire transfer request and such wire transfer was returned to us.</p>


<ol start="8" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation or Amendment of Wire Transfer</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once we receive a wire transfer request, it may not be able to be canceled or amended. However, at our discretion, we may use reasonable efforts to act on any request for cancellation or amendment, provided that the method by which we are notified of a request for cancellation or amendment complies with our security procedures. However, we will have no liability if such cancellation or amendment is not affected. Any cancellation or amendment of a wire transfer by us will relieve us of any obligation to act on the original wire transfer request.</p>


<ol start="9" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to the limitation of liability in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the maximum period for which we will be liable for interest on any amount to be refunded or paid to you with respect to an unauthorized, erroneous, or other wire transfer request is thirty (30) days.</p>


<ol start="10" class="txt-body-md">
<li>Your Liability for Unauthorized Wire Transfers</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Except as otherwise provided by law, you will be liable for all Losses to which your negligence contributed or which resulted in unauthorized, fraudulent, or dishonest acts by your current and/or former authorized representatives. Such liability includes instances when a current or former authorized representative effects one or more wire transfers or improper use of telephone security procedures to affect a wire transfer to your detriment.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">If we receive a levy, attachment, or other legal process against you (collectively, “Legal Process”), we may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your Account until the Legal Process is dismissed or satisfied. Any Legal Process will be subject to our right of set-off and security interest. You are responsible for all Losses we incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your Account. If we receive a claim against the funds in your Account, or if we know of or believe that there is a dispute as to the ownership or control of funds in your Account, we may, in our discretion: (a) place a hold on your Account and refuse to pay out any funds until we are satisfied that the dispute is settled; (b) close your Account and send the balance to the named account holder; (c) require a court order to act; or (d) take any other action we feel is necessary to protect us.

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US.&nbsp;</strong></p>


<ol class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Election to Arbitrate</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">You, ZenBusiness, and the Bank agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for resolution of a claim be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this section (the “Arbitration Provision”). As used in this Arbitration Provision, “Claim” will include any past, present, or future claim, dispute, or controversy involving you (or persons claiming through or connected with you), on the one hand, and us on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from this Agreement, including the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire Agreement. Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether they arise from contract; tort (intentional or otherwise); a constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or otherwise. Claims include matters arising as initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or otherwise. Please note that you may continue to assert Claims in small claims court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The scope of this Arbitration Provision is to be given the broadest possible interpretation that is enforceable.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You have the right to opt-out of this arbitration clause and it will not affect any other terms and conditions of this Agreement or your relationship with us. TO OPT OUT, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING OF YOUR INTENT TO DO SO WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER OPENING YOUR ACCOUNT. Your opt-out notice can be a letter that is signed by you that states “I elect to opt out of the arbitration clause in my Business Deposit Account Agreement for Account #” or any words to that effect. Send the notice to: 210 East Main Street, Rogersville, Tennessee 37857. An election to opt out applies only to the account or accounts identified in your opt-out notice or, if no specific accounts are identified in your notice, then to any account(s) that became subject to the arbitration clause within the sixty (60)-day period before we received your notice. The arbitration clause will apply to any claims between us relating to any account(s) for which we do not receive an opt-out notice as described in this subsection.</p>


<ol start="2" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act; Arbitrator’s Powers&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and will be governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”). The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator may award damages or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to the limitations set forth in this Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court. The arbitrator will take steps to reasonably protect confidential information. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator will apply the limitation of liability set forth above and, for the avoidance of doubt, is not empowered to award (a) punitive or exemplary Losses, except where permitted by statute, or (b) incidental, indirect or consequential Losses, or Losses for lost profits. The parties waive any right to recover all such Losses.</p>


<ol start="3" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Dispute Resolution&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">If a Claim arises, our goal is to address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so, to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. You agree that before filing any claim in arbitration, you will first submit your Claim to us by email at the address specified above and provide us with the opportunity to resolve your concern prior to initiating arbitration.</p>


<ol start="4" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration Procedures&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">The party initiating arbitration will do so with the Judicial Alternatives and Mediation Services (“JAMS”). The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator according to, and the location of the arbitration will be determined in accordance with, the rules and policies of the administrator selected, except to the extent the rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any countervailing law. If you have any questions concerning JAMS or would like to obtain a copy of the JAMS arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 352-5267 or visit their web site at: <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" rel="noopener">www.jamsadr.com</a>. In the case of a conflict between the rules and policies of the administrator and this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision will control, subject to countervailing law, unless all parties to the arbitration consent to have the rules and policies of the administrator apply. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, or any other location we agree to.</p>


<ol start="5" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration Fees&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">If we initiate arbitration, we will pay all the administrator’s filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you initiate arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) will be paid in accordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the administrator’s rules. We will pay the administrator’s hearing fees for one (1) full day of arbitration hearings. Fees for hearings that exceed one (1) day will be paid by the party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator’s rules or applicable law require otherwise, or you request that we pay them and we agree to do so. Each party will bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights will apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.</p>


<ol start="6" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeals&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Within thirty (30) days of a final award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel selected according to the rules of the arbitrator administrator. In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party may cross-appeal within thirty (30) days after notice of the appeal. The panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that are appealed. Costs and conduct of any appeal will be governed by this Arbitration Provision and the administrator’s rules, in the same way as the initial arbitration proceeding. Any award by the individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel award on appeal, will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>


<ol start="7" class="txt-body-md">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;No Class Actions&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, no party to the arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration unless those persons are parties to a single transaction. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in arbitration will determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator or arbitrator will have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this section, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, will be invalid and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this section will be determined exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination of this Agreement. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than the subsection titled “No Class Actions” is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision will nevertheless remain valid and in force. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Arbitration Provision’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief or particular term, then that claim (and only that claim) or that term (and only that term) must be severed from the Arbitration Provision and may be brought in court. If an arbitration is brought on a class, representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings in the previous subsection are finally adjudicated pursuant to the last sentence of that subsection as unenforceable, then no arbitration will be had. In no event will any invalidation be deemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.</p>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial Forum for Claims&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<p class="txt-body-md">Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that this Arbitration Provision is found not to apply to you or your Claim, you and the Bank agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Tennessee. Both you and the Bank consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. All parties agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY BUT ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING THAT RIGHT BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ARBITRATION PROVISION.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin">2.<strong>&nbsp;Interpretation</strong></h3>

<p class="txt-body-md">Except with respect to Indemnified Parties and except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not be construed to give any third party any interest or rights (including any third-party beneficiary rights) with respect to or in connection with any agreement or provision contained herein or contemplated hereby.&nbsp; Use of the Account is subject to all applicable rules and customs of any clearinghouse or other association involved in transactions. The Bank does not waive its rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at any time. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the court or other tribunal making such determination is authorized and instructed to modify this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible so that the transactions and agreements contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. The headings in this Agreement are only for convenience and do not in any way limit or define your or our rights or obligations under this Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and other agreements or disclosures you may receive from us with respect to the Account or your debit card, contain the entire statement of the terms and conditions, which apply to the subject matter hereof. If any term or condition of this Agreement should be invalidated or unenforceable for any reason, all other terms and conditions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
