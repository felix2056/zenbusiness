With millions of residents and a wide range of potential industries, the Golden State presents many opportunities to ambitious entrepreneurs. In 2021, WalletHub ranked California             as number 3 among its ten best states to start a business. Some reasons for this high ranking included access to resources and availability of human capital.&nbsp;         </p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Starting a California LLC is a smart way to give your business security. This type of business entity can protect your personal assets, give you flexibility in running your business, and identify your company with the state of California. An LLC
            can also help add legitimacy to your business idea.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">That said,&nbsp;forming an LLC in California can seem trickier than trying to merge lanes in bumper-to-bumper L.A. traffic. But don’t worry. This guide will walk you through the entire process, step-by-step, for forming your California LLC. We’ll

<p class="txt-body-md">Wondering how to start an LLC in California? You’ll need to file&nbsp;formation documents&nbsp;with the state. Our filing service can handle these legal documents for you, but we’ll show you the process, too.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">LLC California Formation Process</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Starting a California LLC begins with&nbsp;choosing a name. You’ll need to check that the name you want isn’t already registered to another business owner. Your name must also follow all state guidelines. For example, California LLC names     cannot be vulgar or include words that might mislead the public.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Next, you’ll need to find an&nbsp;agent for service of process&nbsp;and fill out paperwork, such as your&nbsp;     Articles of Organization&nbsp;and&nbsp;Statement of Information. These forms tell the state of California basic information about your company, such as who’s involved, where you’re located, and what type of business     you’re in. Filing these forms will allow you to move forward with your new company. California also requires you to create an&nbsp;LLC operating agreement, which details how your business will be run.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Finally, you’ll get set up with the&nbsp;IRS&nbsp;and apply for any business licenses, permits, or insurance policies that are required by your industry.&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">6 Steps to a Limited Liability Company in California</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Below, we’ll cover how to form an&nbsp;LLC in California<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in six simple steps. We’ll also include some other helpful information to set up your LLC for success.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Note that these guidelines are for starting a domestic LLC, which is one started within the state you’re residing in. A foreign LLC is one that originated in a different state. To register a foreign LLC in California, you would complete a registration
    statement for a foreign LLC and follow a different process.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>The first step to starting your business is to name your California LLC</strong>. Unlike a sole proprietorship (which typically has the same name as the person who runs it), LLCs often opt for branded company names.
</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your name plays a huge part in how the public views and perceives your brand. So, it’s important to make a great choice.
</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-name-requirements-for-a-limited-liability-company-in-california">Name Requirements for a Limited Liability Company in California</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">When forming an LLC – California requires the words “<strong>Limited Liability Company</strong>” or the abbreviations “
    <strong>L.L.C.</strong>” or “<strong>LLC</strong>” in your formal name. You may also abbreviate “Limited” to “Ltd.” and “Company” to “Co.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Reading up on the state’s naming guidelines to ensure you’re following all the rules. A few of the general guidelines include:
</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Avoiding profanities</li>



<li>Not using an already registered name (or one that’s confusingly similar to a name already in use)</li>



<li>Avoiding names that could mislead the public</li>



<li>Avoiding names that make your company sound like a government agency or entity (like “police,” “county,” and “state”)
    </li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-reserving-a-business-name">Reserving a Business Name</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">It’s important to make sure your desired name hasn’t already been taken in the state of California. Our&nbsp;<a href="california-business-search.html">California business search</a>&nbsp;page can help you with that. If you find that your name is available     but you’re not yet ready to file Articles of Organization with the state of California, you can reserve it. </p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-file-a-fictitious-business-name-fbn-in-california">File a Fictitious Business Name (FBN) in California</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Next, you may want to consider a&nbsp;<a href="california-dba.html">California FBN&nbsp;name</a>. Some businesses use an FBN (or “fictitious business name”) when they register under a different moniker. This is also known as a “doing business as”     or&nbsp;DBA&nbsp;name in most other states.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">There are many reasons a company will use a DBA name, such as introducing a new product line. Some examples of when a DBA name would be used include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>An LLC with the official company name “ABC Toys, LLC” wants to sell toys online as “ABC Toys”</li>



<li>An LLC with the official company name “ABC Toys, LLC” wants to sell puzzles on Amazon as “ABC Puzzles”</li>



<li>An LLC with the official name “XYZ Computers, LLC” wants to sell online as “XYZ Laptops”</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">By filing for fictitious names, you can avoid having to re-establish your company with the state of California each time you want to do business under a different moniker.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In California, FBNs aren’t registered with the California Secretary of State office, but at the local level. You must file in the county where your business is, and you’ll need to get the necessary forms from your county clerk.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-trademark-your-company-name-or-logo">Trademark your company name or logo</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Registering a trademark</strong>&nbsp;in California can help protect your business or DBA from being used by others in the state. A brand logo or company name trademark can be beneficial to your business, even as a new LLC. Placing a trademark
    on your name or brand’s design helps keep it from being copied or stolen by existing or upcoming businesses. It helps protect your intellectual property and provides you with standing ground in the event of copyright infringement.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">When starting your LLC in California, intellectual property includes things like:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Your brand name</li>



<li>Your logo</li>



<li>Inventions</li>



<li>Written or artistic work</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Holding a trademark means that you “own” the right to use certain words or designs, and others are infringing on that ownership if they copy or repeat your work. Likewise, it means that another business cannot have the same name as yours.
</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can learn more about California’s guidelines on the Secretary of State website. Regardless of whether you want to apply for your own trademark, it’s wise to search the California trademark database to make sure your desired business name hasn’t already
    been trademarked in the state.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">By the same token, you’ll want to check the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database to make sure your name hasn’t been federally trademarked. If it is available, you can apply to register it on the USPTO website. Please keep in mind that this
    process is not immediate, but can provide broader protection if you plan on doing business outside of California.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-register-a-trademark-in-california">Register a trademark in California</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In the state of California, you can file to register a trademark for a fee of $70 per “classification code.” You can fill out the “Trademark / Service Mark – Application for Registration” (Form TM-100) online, in person, or by mail via the California
    Secretary of State. Online and in-person drop-offs are marked with the time and date that they are received. Mail submissions are marked at 5 p.m. of the day they are delivered.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once approved, you will receive a free copy. You can also request a certified copy for a fee. Learn more about trademarks on our&nbsp;<a href="trademark-vs-copyright.html">trademark vs. copyright</a>&nbsp;page.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Secure a domain name for your LLC</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Secure a website domain name</strong>&nbsp;to help potential customers find you online. You can conduct a quick&nbsp;
    <a href="business-name-checker.html">online domain name search</a>&nbsp;to make sure the domain name you want is available, and then have us&nbsp;<a href="domain-registration.html">register that domain</a>&nbsp;for you.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For help naming your business and other filing services, look to our online services. With a range of affordable options, we can help you with the paperwork to set up your business, which gives you time to focus on actually growing your company.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Is your California LLC name available as a web domain?</strong>&nbsp;</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to considering general business name availability for your California LLC, you also need to think about whether your desired name is available as a URL. Finding a business name that can also be used as a web domain means your website will
    be easier to find and remember for your customers (or potential customers).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Use our&nbsp;<a href="business-name-checker.html">domain name search tool</a>&nbsp;to see if your preferred business name is available as a URL. If the domain you want is still available, you might even want to reserve it before someone else does.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can also check to see if your desired social media handles are available. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are a huge avenue for marketing today’s businesses. Getting the right social media names can be an important
    factor in your branding strategy.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We have a&nbsp;<a href="domain-registration.html">domain name service</a>&nbsp;to help you find and purchase a domain name for your company. We can also help you create a&nbsp;<a href="webpage.html">business         website</a>&nbsp;and provide&nbsp;<a href="get-domain.html">domain name privacy</a>.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>The next step is to appoint a&nbsp;<a href="california-agent-service-process.html">California agent for service of process</a></strong>. In other states, this is more commonly referred to as a registered agent. The agent for service of process is a person or business entity assigned to receive legal notices (such as subpoenas) and official correspondence on behalf of your business.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-agent-for-service-of-process-requirements">Agent for service of process requirements</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The California requirements for an agent for service of process include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Being a resident of California or a company authorized to do business in the state</li>



<li>Having a physical mailing address in California (a P.O. box will not suffice)</li>



<li>Being over the age of 18</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can appoint yourself or another member of the company to be your agent, or you can hire an outside source to serve in this position.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-agent-for-service-of-process-responsibilities">Agent for Service of Process Responsibilities</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">An agent for service of process:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Will be notified if the business has been sued or has had legal action taken against it</li>



<li>Is responsible for relaying any information received to the appropriate people at your LLC</li>



<li>Should always be available during normal business hours to receive service of process</li>



<li>Must accept important government mail</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-hiring-a-registered-agent-service">Hiring a Registered Agent Service</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">By using a&nbsp;<strong>registered agent service</strong>, you can free up time to focus on your business since you won’t have to be available during regular business hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional perks of hiring a registered agent service include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Private receipt of potentially embarrassing paperwork (for instance, legal action that’s taken against you)</li>



<li>Ability to move your office location without having to update your registered agent address with the state</li>



<li>Assurance that notifications will be received and dealt with in a dependable, timely manner</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-what-if-the-state-can-t-find-my-california-agent-for-service-of-process"><strong>What if the state can’t find
        my California agent for service of process?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If the state is unable to make contact when sending you legal notifications, your business could fall out of compliance. That’s why it’s so important to maintain an up-to-date agent for service of process.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">A few instances in which failure to make contact could happen easily include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>If your agent isn’t in the office (for example, out of town, on vacation, sick, etc.) when contact is attempted
    </li>



<li>If the agent moves or quits and you forget to update your paperwork (or residence address) with the state</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Failing to maintain an agent for service of process (also called a registered agent in other states) could mean that the state will dissolve your LLC in California. This would also result in you losing your <a href="llc-protection-california.html">liability protection in California</a> (which was likely the main     reason you started an LLC in the first place).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Not keeping your agent for service of process information (such as the physical address) up-to-date could also lead to a process server being unable to notify you of an impending lawsuit. In that scenario, a court case against you could go forward without     your knowledge.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-sm txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-zenbusiness-can-be-your-agent-for-service-of-process"><strong>ZenBusiness can be your agent for service of

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Next, you need to file your</strong>&nbsp;<strong>California Articles of Organization</strong>. This form explains things such as who’s involved in your LLC and their contact information. Articles of Organization are required for any LLC in the
    state of California. Fortunately, we specialize in handling this kind of paperwork with our&nbsp;
    <a href="pricing-products.html">business formation plans</a>. So, we can take care of this step for you and make sure it’s done correctly the first time.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Unlike many other states, California requires two separate forms to be filed in order to form your LLC. First, there are the aforementioned Articles of Organization. Next, is the Statement of Information (which we’ll cover in the following step).&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-what-to-include-in-your-california-llc-articles-of-organization">What to include in your California LLC Articles of Organization</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">California LLC Articles of Organization should include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Your business name and address</li>



<li>Contact information</li>



<li>Your name and information for your agent for service of process</li>



<li>Whether your LLC will be <a href="member-managed-vs-manager-managed-llc.html">manager-managed or member-managed</a></li>



<li>Signature of the organizer</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Most LLCs choose member-managed, meaning the members (owners) all share in the running and management of the business. In a manager-managed LLC, the members appoint one or more managers to manage the company. These appointees can be members of the LLC     or someone hired from outside.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-file-paperwork-in-person-by-mail-or-online-with-the-california-secretary-of-state">File paperwork in-person, by mail, or online with the California Secretary of State</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">California does not charge a filing fee when submitting your Articles of Organization. However, there may be a fee for submitting paperwork in person. All in-person filings are considered to be expedited and will be processed faster than online or mail
    submissions. There are additional fees associated with in-person filings.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You may choose to have your paperwork pre-cleared and/or expedited to hit a specific timeline. Next-day approval services are available. You will need to mail or drop off the paperwork in person at the Sacramento office public counter. These services
    are not available at the Los Angeles Secretary of State location. We also have a&nbsp;<a href="pricing-formation-speeds.html">fast filing speed service</a>&nbsp;to help you expedite the LLC formation process.
</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Preparation for forming an LLC in California with&nbsp;applicable forms&nbsp;for pre-clearance and expedited services should be done respectively.</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Pre-clearance services: “Provide a customer with the option to submit a business entity document in person to the Secretary of State’s Sacramento office prior to filing to determine if the document conforms to law and to receive a pre-clearance response
        within a guaranteed time frame.”</li>



<li>Expedited filing services: “Provide a customer with the opportunity to submit for filing a business entity document in person to the Secretary of State’s Sacramento office and to receive a filing confirmation or filing response within a guaranteed
        time frame.”</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-file-in-person-for-expedited-processing-in-california">File in-person for expedited processing in California
</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The expedited timelines are guaranteed and begin at the time that the paperwork is received. For example, if you file the 24-hour pre-clearance form Tuesday at noon, your pre-clearance will begin Wednesday at noon.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">All expedited paperwork must include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The file you’re submitting. The file needs to be signed by all involved parties. This will be personally delivered to the California Secretary of State’s office in Sacramento. Digital signatures are not viable or accepted by the state on paper copies.</li>



<li>A copy of your pre-clearance response</li>



<li>Your complete filing fee</li>



<li>The complete expedited fee (this will need to be a separate check and will be deposited even if your request is rejected)
    </li>



<li>A note and/or instructions on your requested class, as well as specific filing date, if applicable</li>



<li>Notification on filing response (how do you want to be notified?)</li>



<li>The name and phone number for a point of contact</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Filing your Articles of Organization can be done on a quick schedule, as long as you follow the proper protocol. Consider this option if you’re in need of a quick turnaround or have hard dates for forming an LLC in California.
</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The Articles of Organization are usually approved within seven business days without expedited or pre-clearance services. </p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-digitally-store-your-california-limited-liability-company-documents">Digitally store your California limited liability company documents</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you have us handle filing your Articles of Organization, once the state of California approves your LLC, you can digitally store and organize your paperwork in your ZenBusiness dashboard. This is where you can keep it and other important paperwork
    digitally organized.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you get your physical paperwork back from the state approving your new California Limited Liability Company, you’ll want to keep it in a safe location along with your other important documents, such as your LLC operating agreement, member certificates,
    contracts, compliance checklists, transfer ledger, legal documents, etc. We offer a customized business kit to help you keep these important documents organized and looking professional.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-member-managed-or-manager-managed"><strong>Member-Managed or Manager-Managed?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">A crucial step when starting an LLC in California is determining your new business’s management structure. Will your LLC be managed by the members/owners (member-managed) or by an outside/hired manager (manager-managed)?</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Many LLCs opt for member-management because they only have a few owners or just one. In those cases, it often makes sense for the LLC owner(s) to select member-management because they’re running the day-to-day business operations themselves. All of the
    owners are sharing in running the business and making decisions for it.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Other LLCs prefer to appoint or hire a manager instead. In the manager-managed option, one or more LLC members can be appointed to make management decisions, or someone from outside the LLC can be hired to manage the company.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Manager-management can be helpful when some of the members only wish to be investors in the company as opposed to running the business and making decisions about it. LLCs that have many members also sometimes find it easier to have a manager because it’s     difficult to get all the members together to make decisions.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-why-would-i-delay-my-california-llc-filing-date"><strong>Why would I delay my California LLC filing
        date?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">One of the biggest reasons new entrepreneurs choose to delay their LLC filing date is to avoid taxes and costs for a little longer. In this case, they delay their filing until January 1 of the following year.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">When doing so, they can avoid having to pay taxes on an LLC in the current year. This is especially true if the future LLC owners don’t need to establish the company right away and want to avoid that $800 California franchise tax fee for a little longer.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Ordinarily, if the California Secretary of State approves your filing, the filing effective date will be the date you submitted it. This is true even if it takes longer than that for the state to examine it and mark it as filed. In other words, if you
    submit your filing on July 1, but the state doesn’t approve it until July 30, your LLC effective date would still be July 1.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">But you also have the option to tell the state that you want your effective date to be at a later time. You can choose to have your LLC’s effective date be up to 90 days past the date you submit the filing.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This is something else we can help you with. When you form your LLC in California with us, we give you the option of paying an extra fee to have your LLC’s effective date delayed. (This service is only offered from October to January.) </p>

<div class="wp-block-group is-style-grid-full has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="file-california-statement-of-information">Step 4: File California Statement of Information</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Next, you’ll submit your</strong>&nbsp;<strong>California Statement of Information</strong>. This is the second part of the initial paperwork in starting your LLC in the Golden State. Remember, this step is in addition to filing the Articles of
    Organization.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your Statement of Information has to be filed within 90 days of formation to retain your LLC name and status with the state.
</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The&nbsp;Statement of Information&nbsp;is also filed with the California Secretary of State and can be done in person or&nbsp;online. There’s an accompanying filing fee.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Because each entity can be updated on the California Secretary of State website, it’s important that you are dealing with your own LLC. Accidentally modifying the wrong business can lead to prosecution by the state.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Finally, when filing your Statement of Information, remember that this information will be open for public record.
</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-biennial-report">Biennial Report</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll also need to renew the Statement of Information every two years, as long as you continue to operate and remain in business. This type of reporting is known as an&nbsp;<a href="annual-reports.html">Annual Report</a>&nbsp;or Biennial Report in other
    states.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">When refiling within your intended time slot, there’s a fee for renewal on all California LLCs. If you have more than one member within your LLC, you’ll need to add an&nbsp;attachment&nbsp;to the Statement of Information. This is added to the original
    paperwork with no additional charge.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-tips-for-getting-your-application-approved">Tips for Getting Your Application Approved</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">According to the state of California’s business website, there’s a large portion of applications that can’t be processed due to typographical errors, issues with their business name, or omitted items in the applicant’s Articles of Organization. To avoid
    these errors, which could potentially slow down or halt your LLC completion process, check out these tips provided by the state.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-name-reservations">Name Reservations</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">As mentioned earlier, check to ensure that your business name has not already been registered. A name that is in use will cause your application to be denied and force you to start the process over with a new name. Check your preferred business name before
    filing so that this simple mistake won’t slow you down.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-electronic-signatures">Electronic Signatures</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The state of California has very clear guidelines as to what constitutes a legal digital signature. While typing your name in as a signature on an electronic device is acceptable, you will also need paperwork confirming the use of electronic signatures
    and that all parties are signing digitally. In addition, the Secretary of State website advises: “Electronic signatures on filings submitted through the Secretary of State’s online process are the only electronic signatures that are acceptable for
    filings with the Secretary of State. Computer-generated signatures or fonts made to look like a signature printed on paper filings are not acceptable.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This also means you can’t digitally sign paperwork and print it for expedited filing. When using paper copies of LLC forms, all paperwork should be signed in person. Keep this in mind when multiple signatures are a requirement, especially when dealing
    with members who live far apart. The state’s Sacramento office only accepts paper copies. These can be mailed if you’re not local or within driving distance from the Secretary of State location.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Your&nbsp;<a href="california-operating-agreement.html">California operating agreement</a>&nbsp;outlines the
        rules and operating procedures for the management of the LLC</strong>, much like the bylaws required by corporations. Your operating agreement should include information such as:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Whether members have the right to admit additional members</li>



<li>An explanation of the business’s terms and conditions</li>



<li>How the business will be managed and ran</li>



<li>The circumstances, if any, under which the cessation of membership of one or more members will result in the LLC’s dissolution</li>



<li>A plan of succession for when a member passes away (the agreement can also stipulate what happens to that member’s portion of the business)</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Unlike some other states, California law actually requires LLCs to have an operating agreement. Aside from just being a legal requirement, your California operating agreement&nbsp;is a great resource to look back on in a time of need. Keep it on file
    and update it as your business changes.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-california-llc-operating-agreements">California LLC Operating Agreements</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Most states do not require LLC operating agreements, but California does. Your company can&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from an operating agreement for many reasons:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>To help uphold the limited liability aspect of your limited liability company in the eyes of the courts</li>



<li>Settling disagreements between LLC members</li>



<li>Clarifying business structure ownership</li>



<li>Proving legitimacy with financial institutions, the state, and the federal government</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Even single-member LLC businesses are required to have this document in California.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Although an&nbsp;operating agreement&nbsp;is required by the state of California, you’re not required to file it. It should be kept on hand with your company’s files so it can be referred to in times of need. For instance, if there’s a dispute among LLC
    members or a change in industry standards, the operating agreement will be looked upon for guidance.
</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Not sure how to create an operating agreement for your California Limited Liability Company? We offer an&nbsp;<a href="operating-agreement.html">operating agreement template</a> to help you get started.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-do-i-need-an-operating-agreement-if-i-m-the-only-owner"><strong>Do I need an operating agreement if I’m the
        only owner?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">While it’s true that operating agreements can help you avoid disputes among LLC members, that’s not the only reason for having one. In fact, even single-member LLCs can benefit from this internal document.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For one, they are required for all LLCs in California. Additionally, potential investors, future business partners, and others may want to see your operating agreement.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Furthermore, many banks won’t let you open a business bank account without one. Your operating agreement can also spell out what you want to happen to the business if you die or become incapacitated.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Occasionally, someone will take an LLC owner to court to try to prove that the owner and the LLC are the same entity so that they can go after the owner’s personal assets. If that happens, having an operating agreement in place is one more thing to further     demonstrate to the court that the owner and the LLC truly are separate.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group is-style-grid-full has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="apply-for-an-ein">Step 6: Apply for an EIN</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is the tax ID number for your LLC</strong>. This number is also commonly referred to as a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your EIN identifies your company to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) much like your Social Security number identifies you with the federal government. Just as you use your Social Security Number to file personal taxes, you’ll use your EIN to file business
    taxes.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">An EIN also allows you to open a business bank account and is a requirement for hiring employees.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can get your California Limited Liability Company’s EIN through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website, by mail, or by fax. Don’t want to deal with the government agency yourself? No worries, we can get it for you. Our&nbsp;

</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">After you have your EIN, you’ll be able to open a&nbsp;business bank account&nbsp;for your LLC. Separating your business accounts from your personal banking is critical. By doing so, you avoid commingling funds and get a better handle     on your finances for tax time.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">(Note: You can also get a&nbsp;business credit card. By using a business credit card for company expenses, you further separate personal and business funds.)</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to making tax filing more difficult, commingling funds could also be used against you. If someone takes you to court to challenge whether you and your LLC are truly separate entities (that is, they’re trying to sue you for your personal funds,
    not just your business’s), having a separate bank account for the business helps establish to the court that your LLC is legitimate and separate from you.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In conjunction with LendingClub, we offer a&nbsp;<a href="pricing-banking.html">discounted bank account</a>&nbsp;for your new LLC. This allows for unlimited transactions, online banking, a debit card, and more. When you want to authorize others in your business

<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-can-filing-as-an-s-corp-lower-my-taxes"><strong>Can filing as an S corp lower my taxes?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">LLCs are one of the most common types of business structures thanks in large part to the flexibility they offer. One of those flexibilities comes in how you can choose to have your LLC taxed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">An LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship by default if it has only one member. And the default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is a partnership. This means LLCs avoid the “double taxation” faced by many corporations, in which a business pays
    taxes at both the business level and again when the income is paid to the individual owners. But some LLCs opt to be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation because it works to their advantage.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Being taxed as a C corporation does mean you get double taxation. That said, for certain LLCs, the pros can sometimes outweigh the cons. C corporations have the widest range of tax deductions, which could be an advantage in some scenarios. For example,
    insurance premiums can be written off as business expenses.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">S corp is short for “Subchapter S Corporation,” and is geared toward small businesses. Having your LLC taxed as an S corp has pass-through taxation like a standard LLC, but there’s another potential advantage:&nbsp;It could         save you money on self-employment taxes.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">It does this by allowing you to be an “employee-owner,” and split your income into your salary and your share of the company’s profits. In this way, you pay self-employment taxes on your salary, but not your profits. That said, while most states don’t     make S corps pay income taxes, California is an exception.&nbsp;All California LLCs that         choose S corp as their tax filing classification must pay a 1.5% state franchise tax on their net         income.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The other drawback is that the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizes S corps very closely, meaning you’re more likely to get audited. S corps are also harder to qualify for.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">While it’s possible that one of the above options could work better for your LLC, we don’t need to tell you that taxes are very complicated. They’re also very specific to your situation. That’s why you really need to consult a tax professional to see     which taxing method works best for your California business.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-recurring-costs-for-your-california-llc">Recurring Costs for Your California LLC&nbsp;</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The California Franchise tax board requires all businesses to pay an&nbsp;annual franchise tax of         $800. Under Form FTB 3522, LLC owners must file with the state and pay their annual tax to the Franchise Tax Board by the 15th day of the 4th month following their business’s formation. Even though it can take a month for filing to process,     this counts as the first month.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This tax payment are due for all California LLCs, regardless of annual income or annual revenue. The funds are due as long as the business is operational.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Businesses will owe the full amount per calendar year, no matter how many months they remained in business. For example, if you opened your LLC in November, the franchise tax will be due Feb. 15 of the following year. (Because November counts as the first
    month, those fees will actually fall three and a half months after filing.)</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Fees are due to all businesses still in operation with the state, even if they do not have an income for the calendar year. Dissolving the business is the only way to free your business of California franchise taxes.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The only exceptions to the California franchise tax law are as follows. LLCs are not subject to pay the annual fee if&nbsp;     both&nbsp;of the following statements are true:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>They did not conduct any business in California during the tax year</li>



<li>Their tax year consisted of 15 or fewer days</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">From then on, your LLC will pay for the calendar year by April 15, or tax day, for that year. This payment will cover January to December of that year. Keep in mind that can mean two&nbsp;payments&nbsp;in short succession, depending on when the business
    LLC paperwork is filed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Another exception occurs if you cancel your LLC within one year of forming. In this case, you can file a Short Form Cancellation SOS Form LLC-4/8 with the Secretary of State. Your LLC will not be liable for paying the $800 franchise tax for its first
    tax year.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-busy-season-for-state-of-california-filing-llc-paperwork">Busy Season for State of California Filing LLC Paperwork
</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Due to the nature of these payments, California is often busier filing LLC paperwork toward the beginning of the year. Keep in mind that it could take longer during this time to be approved and receive your paperwork.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Filing forms can also be post-dated, but not by more than 90 days. Therefore, if you open your LLC toward the end of a calendar year, you could potentially save funds by waiting to file all necessary paperwork until after New Year.
</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Going forward, the annual franchise fee will always be due on April 15, eliminating the piggyback payments that can occur in your first year of filing.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This franchising fee is an additional fee that most states do not charge.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your Statement of Information will also need to be renewed every other year, along with a fee.</p>

<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Legal security and proper standing with the government</li>
<li>Limited personal liability</li>
<li>Better tax options</li>
<li>More freedom than a corporation has, without more business structure requirements</li>

        <p class="txt-body-md">Your California LLC will need to pay a wide variety of business taxes. These include the taxes payable to the California government, like California sales tax and California state tax. You will also need to pay federal, self-employment, and possibly payroll tax to the IRS, based on factors such as how much your LLC pulls in annually and whether you hire employees.</p>
<p class="txt-body-md">Unless they opt to be taxed as a C corporation, California LLC members only pay federal income tax on their personal tax returns, while the business itself is exempt from federal income taxes.</p>
<p class="txt-body-md">As of this writing, California LLCs must pay, at a minimum, $800 in annual franchise tax to the state government every year. For LLCs with more than $250,000 in annual income, this franchise tax increases incrementally.</p>
<p class="txt-body-md">California business owners carry a particularly heavy tax burden, so it’s a good idea to talk with an accountant or other tax professional to determine what you’ll owe to the federal, state, and local governments.</p>

During the peak season, which lasts from December to January, this can take up to six to seven business days.

<p class="txt-body-md">If you don’t have the time or inclination to do all this research, or if you just want the peace of mind to know that your Limited Liability Company has all the business licenses and permits it’s legally required to have, our&nbsp;<a href="pricing-business-license-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business license report service</a>&nbsp;can do the work for you.</p>
<p class="txt-body-md">If you have employees, California requires you to carry workers’ compensation insurance. In addition, if your business owns any vehicles, they’re required to have commercial auto insurance.</p>
<p class="txt-body-md">Along with the insurance policies required by law, other types of insurance coverage may help protect the investment you’ve made in your LLC. Talk to a qualified insurance agent to see what could benefit your business.</p>
