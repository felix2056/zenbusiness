If you’re a first-time entrepreneur, then a Montana LLC may be in your cards. The Treasure State isn’t only rich in mineral reserves. It’s also a treasure trove of opportunities for small business success. Setting up an LLC in Montana can offer a variety of advantages.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Starting a business, though, isn’t easy. If it’s your first time, then having no clue what the process involves can feel like trekking Glacier National Park while blindfolded. We want to help you form your LLC. Montana has some important rules for doing so, so read on to learn more.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><p class="txt-body-md">We’ve put together a five-step guide to creating an LLC in Montana. You’ll first have to <strong>come up with a catchy name</strong> that follows the state’s rules. Next comes naming a <strong>registered agent</strong> for the business. The third step is filing your official formation documents: the <strong>Articles of Organization</strong>. After that comes creating an <strong>operating agreement</strong>. Finally, you’ll apply for an <strong>Employer Identification Number</strong> (EIN). These are the basic steps for how to start a Montana LLC.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Don’t let all this overwhelm you. Our guide will detail everything you’ll need to do while making it easy to understand and follow. There’ll also be some additional steps. Consider those carefully when you get to them near the end of the guide. The journey might be a long one, but once your LLC becomes official, you’ll be the business owner you’ve always wanted to be.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Before moving on, know that this guide is for starting a for-profit, domestic LLC in Montana. </strong>If you’re looking to create a foreign LLC (formed outside Montana), a professional limited liability company (PLLC), or another business entity, then you’ll need to follow a different guide. We don’t assist with PLLC or foreign LLC filings. However, we do have a<a href="montana-professional-limited-liability-company.html"> guide that can walk you through PLLC formations</a>.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Pick a name for your LLC in Montana. </strong>Before you get started on any of the other steps in this Montana LLC registration guide, you’ll need to<a href="how-to-name-your-llc.html"> name your business</a>. This is going to be a very important step. You’re essentially giving your business its identity with a name, so you’ll need to choose something that perfectly fits it.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">It needs to be memorable, marketable, and, most importantly, in line with the state’s business name requirements. If you have no idea how to come up with a great name, then check out our<a href="how-to-name-a-business.html"> article on the topic</a>.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Montana Business Naming Rules</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>The Montana Secretary of State has strict guidelines for naming an LLC. </strong>You must follow these rules; otherwise, the Secretary of State will reject your Articles of Organization. Here are a few rules you’ll need to look over:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The name must be distinguishable from other business names registered in the state. This includes foreign businesses.</li>



<li>The name must include one of the following:<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Limited Liability Company</li>



<li>Limited Company</li>



<li>L.L.C.</li>



<li>L.C.</li>



<li>LLC</li>



<li>LC</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>You can abbreviate “limited” as “Ltd.” and “company” as “Co.”</li>



<li>The designator can’t imply that the LLC is a different type of entity. For example, it can’t have “Inc.” as a designator.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Check out Montana Code 35-8-103 for more information about LLC names.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Search your new Montana LLC name and availability</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">When going through the first point above, it’s best to conduct a Montana business search. This can help you determine whether your desired name is available or has already been claimed by another Montana business.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">On the Secretary’s website, you’ll find a “Business Services” page. Here, there’ll be a “Search Your Business” tool you can use. You can also consult our<a href="montana-business-search.html"> Montana business search page</a>.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Reserving a Business Name for Your Montana LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you’ve picked a unique name, you may want to consider reserving it. This way, no one else will claim it while you’re setting up an LLC in Montana. <strong>You’ll need to submit a Reservation of Name form through the Secretary of State’s Enterprise Online Filing Portal.</strong> The reservation is good for 120 days. There are no renewals.&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Is your Montana LLC name available as a web domain?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Going off of our previous section, it’s important to get a domain name that’s identical or as close as possible to your business’s name. You may end up putting this domain name on your company’s signage, marketing materials, and business cards. If so, people will associate this name with your business. Be sure to check that the domain name you want is available.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Almost every business can benefit from having an online presence. It can make it easier for people to learn about your LLC (its hours of operation, business address, phone number, etc.), allows you to<a href="ecommerce-definition.html"> do business online</a>, and helps you build brand awareness through online marketing. You can secure one with us through our<a href="domain-registration.html"> domain name registration service</a>. While you’re at it, look into our<a href="get-domain.html"> domain name privacy</a> and<a href="webpage.html"> business website service</a>, too.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Check your new Montana LLC name for trademarks</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Before choosing a name for your LLC in Montana, check to see if it has a trademark. It’d be unfortunate if, several months into your LLC’s operation, you received a trademark infringement notice. Dealing with this sort of thing can be expensive and time-consuming.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll have to check yourself because the state won’t check for trademarks during your Montana LLC formation. You can check at the federal level with the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) website. At the state level, check out the Montana Enterprise Online Filing Portal’s trademark search tool.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to checking these databases, it’s wise to do Internet searches for your business name, including checking domain names, social media sites, and online phone directories. To be really thorough, you could hire an attorney specializing in trademarks to do the work for you, although this can be pricey.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Getting an Assumed Business Name for Your LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In Montana, an LLC can operate under a name other than its legal one. This is an assumed business name, generally referred to in most states as a<a href="dba.html"> “doing business as” (DBA) name</a>. An LLC can opt to use an assumed business name for many reasons. A popular one is if it plans to offer a new product under a different name.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can register this name by submitting a Registration of Assumed Business Name (ABN/DBA) form with the Secretary of State for $20. We can also help you file this form with our<a href="montana-dba.html"> Montana DBA service</a>.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Name a registered agent for your Montana LLC. </strong>All LLCs in the state must have a<a href="what-is-a-registered-agent.html"> registered agent</a>. This agent is also known in some states as a statutory agent, resident agent, or agent for service of process. You’ll name this person or entity in your Articles of Organization. This agent is responsible for receiving official forms (like tax documents and service of process) on behalf of the LLC.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Who can be a registered agent in Montana?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In Montana, a<a href="montana-registered-agent.html"> registered agent</a> can be an individual or an entity. This agent can also be commercial or non-commercial. If it’s a person, they must be at least 18 years old. The agent must also have a physical address to accept notices in person. The address can’t be a P.O. box. This agent must also be available at their physical address during normal business hours.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Should I be my own registered agent?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Montana allows LLC owners to be their own registered agents. Although this sounds appealing, the drawbacks may change your mind:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>You must be at your registered address during regular business hours.</li>



<li>You won’t be able to leave the office to go on business trips, run errands, go on vacation, or take a sick day.</li>



<li>If you’re served with a lawsuit at the LLC, it can happen in front of clients and customers. This is bad for business and can be very embarrassing.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">You should also know that the business can’t be its own registered agent.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Consider using a registered agent service for your Montana LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You may be apprehensive about spending money on something you can do yourself, but as we discussed above, skipping on being your own registered agent may be the better option. This is where a registered agent service comes in. This service ensures that you have a registered agent at all times, allowing you to avoid any of the scenarios listed in the previous section. You won’t have to worry about the agent leaving the position or retiring, forcing you to search for a new agent.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What if a process server can’t find my registered agent?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If your business is ever sued, then a process server will deliver the notice in person. If they can’t find your registered agent, then you may end up dealing with some issues. You can pay fines, lose your liability protection, lose your good standing status with the state, or even have the business dissolved. Another possibility is having the lawsuit move forward without your knowledge since the process server was unable to deliver the notice.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You may be better off hiring a registered agent service to take care of this responsibility.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>ZenBusiness can provide your registered agent</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’ve already decided that a registered agent service is the way to go, then we can provide you with one. <strong>With our <a href="registered-agent.html">registered agent service</a></strong>, you’ll always have one available for your business, ensuring that it stays in compliance. This agent will also always receive important tax, legal, and other notices from the state.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll know as soon as possible when these forms are ready for you to look at through your online dashboard. You’ll be able to view, download, and print them whenever you want. You’ll never have to worry about keeping these documents organized yourself.</p>

<li>The LLC’s duration period (temporary or continuous)</li>



<li>The LLC’s principal mailing address</li>



<li>The registered agent’s address, name, etc.&nbsp;</li>

<p class="txt-body-md">Be sure to look into Montana Code 35-8-202 for a much more detailed list of requirements for your Articles of Organization.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Filing Montana Articles of Organization</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>To file your Articles of Organization with the Montana Secretary of State, you’ll have to do so online for a fee of $35</strong>. Paper filings aren’t available, so you’ll need to go to the state’s Enterprise Online Filing Portal. Create an account with a username and password. Afterward, choose the Articles of Organization and follow the instructions.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">When having us file for you, you’ll have the option to use our<a href="pricing-formation-speeds.html"> expedited filing service</a>. This won’t speed up the state’s processing time (though you choose that option yourself in the Articles), but it will prioritize filing your Montana LLC’s Articles of Organization.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Member-Managed or Manager-Managed?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your Articles of Organization require you to list the management structure of the LLC. This means having to choose between a member-managed or manager-managed business. Most LLCs prefer the member-managed structure because, as the term suggests, the members oversee the LLC’s management.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">On the other hand, if the members prefer to have someone else take care of this responsibility, they’ll need to name a manager or managers. The manager can be one of the members or an outside party. Members may choose to have a manager-managed structure if they prefer to be investors and not have to worry about running the business. Whichever option you choose, be sure to include this in your Articles of Organization.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Why would I delay my Montana LLC’s filing date?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’re filing your Articles of Organization toward the end of the year, then consider setting your business’s effective date after January 1. Doing this can avoid filing taxes for only a short period of the current year. This can be helpful if you don’t anticipate making any sales or conducting business during such a short period.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In Montana, if approved, your Articles of Organization are effective starting on the date you submitted the form. So, if you filed on March 20 but the document wasn’t approved until March 25, then the effective date is March 20 unless you chose a delayed effective date. You can choose to delay the filing for up to 90 days. If you have us help with your filing, you can delay your filing date for a fee from October until January.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What if I need to make changes to my Articles of Organization?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll only need to file your Articles of Organization once, so if any changes to the business happen, like members joining or leaving the company, then you’ll need to inform the state with<a href="montana-llc-amendment.html"><strong> Articles of Amendment</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This document allows you to state what exactly you’ll be amending to the original Articles. The filing fee is $15.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’d like us to handle this filing for you, then look into our<a href="pricing-amendment.html"> amendment filing service</a>. Our<a href="pricing-worry-free.html"> Worry-Free Compliance service</a> also includes two amendment filings per year.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Keep your LLC documents in one digital dashboard</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">When having us handle your filing needs, your paperwork will appear in your ZenBusiness dashboard after it’s approved by the state. Your important documents will be organized and ready to view whenever you need them. Be sure to also keep your physical paperwork organized and in a place where it’ll be safe. We offer a customized business kit to keep these organized for you.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Write up an operating agreement for your LLC.</strong><a href="montana-operating-agreement.html"><strong> </strong>Your Montana operating agreement</a> lays out your business’s ownership details, rules, and operational procedures. An operating agreement isn’t required by law and you won’t need to file it with the state, but having one can serve as a strong governance tool for the business. <strong>Lacking this agreement means your business will have to follow the state’s default rules for LLCs.</strong></p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Benefits of Montana LLC Operating Agreements</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Since operating agreements establish the rules for your business, they can be incredibly beneficial for an LLC owner. Let’s go over a few pointers:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>You can prevent and resolve conflicts between the LLC’s members by detailing each’s privileges and powers.</li>



<li>You can further emphasize if the business will be member-managed or manager-managed. You’ll first do this in your Articles of Organization.</li>



<li>It can further separate your personal assets from the business’s assets. LLCs do this by default, but you can stress this with an operating agreement.</li>



<li>You can set the requirements for adding new members to the LLC. You can also detail the reasons for and the process of removing members.</li>



<li>You can set up a succession plan for the entire business or the ownership portion of a member who leaves, dies, or becomes incapacitated. A single-member LLC can find this very beneficial. You should also detail what will happen to that member’s portion.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">These are just a few general benefits. There very well may be more that can apply to you and your situation.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What should I include in my Montana LLC operating agreement?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Here are some things you may want to include in your operating agreement:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li><strong>Ownership portions. </strong>If there are multiple members, establish each ownership portion in a manner that everyone is happy with. If there are five owners, you can split ownership evenly at 20% each. You can also have one member own 40%, another own 30%, and the remaining members own 10% each. It’s entirely up to you.</li>



<li><strong>Management structure. </strong>As you did in the Articles of Organization, state if the LLC will be member-managed or manager-managed.</li>



<li><strong>Member responsibilities. </strong>You can list who in the company will be responsible for the business’s finances, who will be responsible for making business deals, etc. You can also detail each member’s voting powers and authorizations.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li><strong>Member removals and additions. </strong>Be sure to include the reasons and steps for removing a member and what will become of their ownership portion (sold to someone else, absorbed by the other members, etc.) The same goes for member additions. List the requirements for doing so.</li>



<li><strong>Dissolution and winding up. </strong>Establish the reasons the LLC will shut down and what will happen to any remaining profits, assets, debts, and more. Be sure to file Articles of Termination to officially dissolve the LLC.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">Not sure how to put an operating agreement together? Don’t worry. We have a<a href="operating-agreement.html"> guided customizable operating agreement template</a> with a chatbot to guide you through the process. You can also provide an e-signature to formalize the agreement.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Do I need an operating agreement even if I’m the only owner?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Even if you’re the LLC’s only owner and feel you don’t need an operating agreement since you won’t be settling disputes among members, it may still be helpful. Remember that you can use the operating agreement to set up what will happen to the LLC should something happen to you. You can choose to have the business handed over to someone else or dissolved entirely.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You should also draft an agreement since banks, investors, and others may want to see the document before working with you. Financial institutions may also want to see this agreement to open a business bank account. And, if the LLC gets taken to court, you can use the agreement to further demonstrate that you and the business are different entities, protecting your personal assets.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group is-style-grid-full has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="h-step-5-apply-for-an-ein">Step 5: Apply for an EIN</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). </strong>This nine-digit number is like a Social Security number that’s unique to your business. It allows you to apply for a business bank account, hire employees, and pay taxes. It’s also known as a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) and a Federal Tax Identification Number.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">A majority of LLCs will need to apply for this number, especially if they have employees or multiple members. When applying for an EIN with the IRS, you can do so online, by mail, or by fax. We can help you get one with our<a href="ein-number.html"> EIN service</a>.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Register for Montana business taxes</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to federal taxes, you’ll also need to register to pay a variety of state taxes. Once you have your EIN, you can visit the Montana Department of Revenue website and either download their registration form or register online with the TransAction Portal (TAP).</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Can filing as an S corp lower my taxes?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The LLC business structure gives you flexibility, and that extends to how you can choose to have your LLC taxed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">An LLC has <a href="pass-through-taxation-definition.html">pass-through taxation</a> by default. Most LLCs like this because it avoids “double taxation,” in which a corporation pays taxes at both the business level and again when the income is paid out to the individual owners. But some LLCs opt to be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation because, in their case, it works to their advantage.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Being taxed as a C corporation does mean you get double taxation, but, for certain LLCs, the pros sometimes outweigh the cons. C corporations have the widest range of tax deductions, which could be a worthwhile advantage, especially for more profitable LLCs. For instance, employee insurance premiums can be written off as a business expense.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">S corp (short for “Subchapter S Corporation”) is a tax status intended for small businesses. Having your LLC taxed as an S corp has pass-through taxation like a standard LLC, but it has another potential advantage for some LLCs: <strong>It could reduce your self-employment taxes.</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Self-employment taxes are the portion of your taxes earmarked for Social Security and Medicare. In a typical LLC, you would pay these on all of your profits.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">But filing as an S corp allows you to be an “employee-owner” and split your income into your salary and your share of the company’s profits. In this way, you pay employment taxes on your salary, but not self-employment taxes on your profits. (You’ll still pay the other applicable taxes on your LLC profits, of course.)</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">S corp status isn’t without its drawbacks, though. The Internal Revenue Service scrutinizes S corps more closely, meaning you’re more likely to get audited. S corps also have more restrictions for qualifying.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Though it’s possible that one of the above options could work better for your LLC, remember that business taxes are rarely simple. They’re also very specific to your situation. That’s why you need to consult a tax professional to see which taxing method works best for your Montana LLC.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We can also help you<a href="montana-s-corporation.html"> apply for S corp status in Montana</a> during your LLC formation.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Open a business bank account</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>After getting an EIN with the IRS, you should consider opening a business bank account.</strong> One thing you don’t want to do is use your personal bank account to keep track of your business’s finances. It can make sorting your finances tougher when tax season rolls around. It can also result in legal trouble if someone in court challenges whether you and the business are separate entities.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Use our<a href="pricing-banking.html"> discounted business bank account service</a>. You can enjoy unlimited transactions, online banking features, a debit card, and more. You can also authorize someone else in your business to access the account with our<a href="pricing-banking-resolution.html"> banking resolution template</a>.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">When managing your business’s finances, you may need some help. Look into<a href="money.html"> ZenBusiness Money</a>. With it, you can track expenses and revenue, create custom invoices, receive payments, and more.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-md zb-default-margin"><strong>Important Steps After Forming an LLC</strong></h2>


<p class="txt-body-md">After submitting your Articles of Organization and getting them approved, you’ll probably have some additional considerations depending on your situation. Here are a few.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Getting Business Insurance for the LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">LLCs come with limited liability, but it’s never a bad idea to look into additional coverages.<a href="get-business-insurance.html"> Business insurance</a> may be your best bet, but what exactly should you look for? Which types of coverage would protect your business the best?</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">There are many insurance companies out there that offer different policies and benefits. Do some research and look into them. You can start by looking into general liability insurance, which many businesses adopt for additional liability protection.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>File your Montana LLC annual report</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Montana requires LLCs to file an<a href="montana-annual-report.html"> annual report</a> with the Secretary of State through the Enterprise Online Filing Portal for a fee of $20. This report is due between January 1 and April 15 each year. This also applies if you formed the LLC during the latter part of the previous year. For example, if you formed your LLC in October, you’ll still need to file the report between those two dates the following calendar year.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Late filings have a $15 fee. If you file after April 15, your submission fee will be $35. Consider using our<a href="annual-reports.html"> annual report service</a> to avoid late submissions.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Hiring Employees in Montana</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If some time passes and your LLC grows enough to<a href="hiring-managing-employees.html"> hire employees</a>, how will you be adding people to the team? What skills, education, and experience will you require? This is where you and the other members (if any) of the LLC will need to sit down and discuss what to look for in a candidate.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can do some research online and see what similar companies are looking for on job-hunting sites. You can also head over to the Montana Department of Labor and Industry website. You’ll find information about the state’s employment laws, tips on conducting background checks, the option to post a job, and more.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Getting a Certificate of Existence</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">A<a href="certificate-good-standing.html"> Certificate of Existence</a>, commonly known as a Certificate of Good Standing, is a document that verifies your LLC has been properly formed and is in good standing with the state. It isn’t required to form an LLC or conduct business in the state, but it can help you do the following and more:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Renew your permits and licenses</li>



<li>Get business insurance</li>



<li>Secure funding</li>



<li>Enter contracts</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you want to get this certificate, you’ll need to request one from the Secretary of State for a fee of $5. If you prefer,<a href="montana-certificate-good-standing.html"> get one with us</a>.</p>
