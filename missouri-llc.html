A sales tax license from the Missouri Department of Revenue is typically needed to collect sales tax on tangible personal property or taxable services. Other licenses and permits may apply depending on your location, industry, and profession. For assistance in identifying and obtaining the necessary licenses and permits, consider using our business license report service."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does it cost to start an LLC in Missouri?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The cost of forming a Missouri LLC ranges from $50 to $130, depending on filing method and additional services like name reservation. For up-to-date fee information, refer to the Missouri Secretary of State website."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is a Missouri LLC taxed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"By default, a Missouri LLC has pass-through taxation, where the business itself doesn&#039;t pay federal income tax on profits. Instead, individual owners report their share of the profits on their personal tax returns. LLCs with one member report income on personal returns, while multi-member LLCs file a separate information return (Form 1065). Owners receive Schedule K-1 forms for reporting their share of profits. LLCs have the option to be taxed as S corporations or C corporations, each offering specific benefits. Consult a tax professional for advice based on your specific circumstances."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the processing time to form my Missouri LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The processing time for forming a Missouri LLC varies depending on factors. Online filing is faster, typically taking three to six business days for processing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to file my operating agreement with the state of Missouri?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, although LLCs must have operating agreements, Missouri doesn&#039;t require filing them with any state agency. Operating agreements are internal documents."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What tax structure should I choose for my Missouri LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Missouri LLC defaults to a pass-through tax entity, but it can elect to be taxed as an S corporation or C corporation. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. To determine the most suitable tax structure for your LLC, seek advice from a qualified tax professional."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does a Missouri LLC require an annual report?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, Missouri LLCs do not need to file an annual report."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do you dissolve a Missouri LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To dissolve a Missouri LLC, members should review the operating agreement for established procedures. For further guidance, refer to our Missouri business dissolution guide."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use an existing LLC from another state to conduct business in Missouri?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, you can use a foreign LLC to conduct business in Missouri after registering it with the state. Registration requires a Certificate of Good Standing from your state of origin to demonstrate compliance with local laws."}}]},{"@type":"HowTo","@id":"https://www.zenbusiness.com/missouri-llc/#CollectionPage_HowTo","description":"Check out our comprehensive guide below to learn more about starting an LLC in Missouri, and how we can help you succeed.","estimatedCost":{"@type":"MonetaryAmount","@id":"https://www.zenbusiness.com/missouri-llc/#CollectionPage_HowTo_MonetaryAmount","currency":"USD","value":"0"},"name":"How to Start an LLC in Missouri for $0 | MO LLC Registration","step":[{"@type":"HowToStep","@id":"https://www.zenbusiness.com/missouri-llc/#CollectionPage_HowToStep0","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://www.zenbusiness.com/missouri-llc/#CollectionPage_HowToStep0_ImageObject0","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/zenbusiness/q_auto,w_571/v1/shared-assets/illustration/state-ill-missouri-header.svg"},"name":"Step 1: Name your Missouri LLC","video":{"@type":"Clip","url":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ruviwrsi5h.mp4?wtime=17","name":"Name Your Missouri LLC Clip 1","description":"Name Your Missouri LLC","startOffset":"17","endOffset":"24","@id":"https://www.zenbusiness.com/missouri-llc/#Clip"},"url":"https://www.zenbusiness.com/missouri-llc/#name-your-missouri-llc","text":"Brainstorming names for your new business can be a fun process, but keep in mind there are rules you&rsquo;ll need to follow.

        </div>


<p class="txt-body-md">Are you thinking of starting your own business as an LLC? Missouri may be the place to do it. The Show-Me state ranked 13th overall in the nation for the Tax Foundation’s 2022 State Business Tax Climate Index Ranks and Component Tax Ranks.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">A <strong>limited liability company</strong> (LLC) is a business structure that gives business owners the liability protection of a corporation without a corporation’s double taxation and rigid requirements. Owners of an LLC, who are called “members,” normally have their personal assets protected from the liabilities and debts of the business. Unlike a corporation, though, LLC profits usually aren’t taxed at the business level before being distributed to the owners.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">LLCs are also intended to be easier to set up and run than a corporation. Still, starting an LLC in Missouri requires you to <strong>follow certain steps</strong> and <strong>meet various requirements</strong>. Understandably, that can be intimidating, especially if you’ve never started a business before.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">LLC requirements vary state by state so it’s important that you are well-versed in Missouri laws before proceeding. Generally, it comes down to these steps:</p>

<div class="wp-block-group is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>How to Start an LLC in Missouri</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">But don’t let some red tape stop you from launching your dream business. After all, as Missouri native Mark Twain said, “The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">And so, we’ve taken Mr. Twain’s advice and broken down the process of how to start an LLC in Missouri into <strong>five basic steps</strong>. As we walk you through these, we’ll also tell you how <a href="pricing-products.html">our services</a> can <strong>make the whole process easier</strong> and help you <strong>start, run, and grow your business</strong>.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Please note that the following guidelines are for starting a <a href="llc.html">domestic LLC</a>, which is one started within the state you’re residing in. A foreign LLC is one that originated in a different state. To register a foreign LLC in Missouri, you would follow a different process.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Okay, let’s show you how to create an LLC in Missouri.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Give your Missouri limited liability company a name.</strong>&nbsp;Brainstorming names is one of the more fun parts of running a business. Still, keep in mind there are rules you’ll need to follow. If the Missouri Secretary of State rejects your name, you’ll have to start the whole filing process over.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Follow Missouri LLC naming guidelines</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Missouri law requires you to follow these rules when naming your LLC:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The name must be distinguishable from any other domestic or foreign business entity already registered in Missouri.</li>



<li>The name must contain a “designator” indicating that it’s an LLC. You can use “Limited Company,” “Limited Liability Company,” or one of the following abbreviations: “LC,” “L.C.,” “LLC,” or “L.L.C.”</li>



<li>You can’t use words that imply that your LLC is a different business entity type, such as “corporation,” “incorporated,” “limited partnership,” “limited liability partnership,” “limited liability limited partnership,” “Ltd.,” or any abbreviations of these words.</li>



<li>The name can’t have any words or phrases that imply or indicate the LLC is organized for any purpose other than what is stated in its Missouri LLC Articles of Organization.</li>



<li>The name can’t imply that the LLC is a governmental agency (for example, using words like “federal,” “state,” “police,” etc.)</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Finding a Unique Name</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">So, how do you know if the name you want hasn’t already been claimed by someone else? You can&nbsp;<strong>conduct a Missouri business search</strong>&nbsp;to find out if your desired business name is available. We’ve created a&nbsp;<a href="missouri-business-search.html">step-by-step Missouri name search guide</a>&nbsp;to make things easier.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’ve decided on a name but you aren’t ready to register your LLC in Missouri,&nbsp;<strong>you can reserve it</strong>&nbsp;with the state for 60 days by completing an Application for Reservation of Name and paying a filing fee.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Check for trademarks</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Although the Secretary of State may accept your LLC name, that doesn’t mean it’s available to use.&nbsp;<strong>Business names can be trademarked</strong>&nbsp;at the federal and state levels. Check with the&nbsp;United States Patent and Trademark Office&nbsp;website to see if anything similar is already trademarked at the federal level.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">State trademarks apply only within the state, but they’re easier and less expensive to get than federal trademarks. To check to see if your name has been trademarked in Missouri or apply for a state trademark of your own, contact the Missouri Secretary of State office at (866) 223-6535.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">It’s also a good idea to do some independent research to see if anyone else has laid claim to the name you want. You can conduct internet searches or even consult a trademark attorney.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Think about your domain name</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Another consideration when choosing a business name is whether you can&nbsp;<strong>find a domain name that matches it</strong>. Even if you can’t find an exact match, you may be able to find something close to use as your website’s URL. If not, you may even want to rethink your first name choice.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Is your Missouri LLC name available as a web domain?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Regardless of whether you sell your products or services directly online, you’re going to want a presence on the web. When potential clients search for you online, you’ll want them to find a website where they can get contact and other basic info about your business.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For this reason, it’s important to get a good domain name that pairs well with your business name. You’re likely going to be putting that URL on your business cards and other marketing materials, and you want people to be able to remember it and associate it with your business.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The perfect domain name for your company may already be taken, but you can still find others. In fact, if you find a fantastic available domain name, it might be worth naming your business after that URL rather than the other way around.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Our&nbsp;<a href="business-name-checker.html">domain name search tool</a>&nbsp;can help you see if your desired business name or some other suitable name is available as a URL. If you find such a domain name, you might want to lock it down before someone else does.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can also check to see what social media handles are available. Many businesses market on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, so getting the appropriate social media names can be important for effective online marketing.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We have a&nbsp;<a href="domain-registration.html">domain name service</a>&nbsp;to help you find and purchase a domain name for your business. We can also help you create a&nbsp;<a href="webpage.html">business website</a>&nbsp;and provide&nbsp;<a href="get-domain.html">domain name privacy</a>.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Registering a Fictitious Name</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If your company will be doing business under a name that’s different from its legal name, Missouri law also requires you to complete a&nbsp;<strong>Fictitious Name Registration</strong>&nbsp;with the Secretary of State and pay a small filing fee. It’s also known as “Doing Business As” (<a href="dba.html">DBA</a>) registration in many states.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This form allows you to market your business under a name other than its official legal name. You can file online or by mail, and the registration must be renewed every five years. Take a look at our&nbsp;<a href="missouri-dba.html">Missouri DBA</a>&nbsp;page for more information and how we can help you with this process.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Name a registered agent for your LLC.</strong>&nbsp;The state needs you to name an individual or business entity that’s responsible for receiving service of process and other important legal notices in person. This person or business is called a registered agent.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Missouri requires you to have a registered agent at all times</strong>, as well as a&nbsp;<strong>registered office</strong>&nbsp;where the agent can be found. The registered office must be a physical street address in Missouri, not a P.O. box or something similar. The registered office does&nbsp;not&nbsp;have to be your business address.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Who can be my registered agent?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Missouri law states that the agent may be either an individual who’s a resident of Missouri with a business office identical to the entity’s registered office, or it may be a corporation authorized to transact business in Missouri with a business office identical to the entity’s registered office.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your&nbsp;<a href="missouri-registered-agent.html">Missouri registered agent</a>&nbsp;must be available to accept legal notices in person at the registered office during normal business hours.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The state also expects you to keep your agent information current. If your agent or registered office changes, you’ll need to file a statement of change of the registered agent. You also need to get the new agent’s written consent and submit it along with this statement.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Benefits of Using Registered Agent Services</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Some business owners assume that the easiest way to meet the registered agent requirement is to appoint themselves as the agent. But this could have some unintended consequences, which is why many use a&nbsp;<a href="registered-agent.html">registered agent service</a>&nbsp;like ours. Some of the benefits include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Discreet receipt of legal notices (as opposed to being served a lawsuit in front of a client)</li>



<li>Ability to move your office location without having to update your agent address with the state</li>



<li>Freedom to leave the office, as the agent must be present at the office during all normal business hours</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll need to include your agent information in your paperwork when you file your LLC with the state. Missouri also allows you to change your agent at any time if necessary.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What if a process server can’t find my Missouri registered agent?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Some business owners think that serving as their own registered agent is the simplest way to meet Missouri’s agent requirement. But consider what could happen if a process server is unable to find you or your appointed agent.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This can occur if you aren’t in the office (for example, out of town, on vacation, sick, etc.) when someone needs to reach the agent. It can also happen if you move and forget to update your paperwork with the state.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to legal penalties for being out of compliance, failing to maintain an agent could mean that a process server can’t find you to notify you of a lawsuit. In that scenario, a court case against you could actually go forward without your knowledge, meaning you wouldn’t even have a chance to defend yourself.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>ZenBusiness can provide your registered agent</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">When you sign up for our registered agent service, we’ll provide you with an agent in Missouri, meaning there will always be someone available to receive important legal, tax, and other notices from the state.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This keeps you in compliance with the registered agent statutes and helps you avoid embarrassing scenarios where you could be served papers for a lawsuit in front of clients.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Our registered agent service also helps keep your paperwork organized. When you get important documents, we’ll quickly inform you and keep them together in your online “dashboard.” From the dashboard, you can view, download, and/or print them whenever you want. You can stop digging through piles of papers to try to find misplaced critical documents.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>File Articles of Organization with the Missouri Secretary of State.</strong>&nbsp;Once the state approves your Missouri LLC online filing and you pay the required filing fee, your LLC will be official.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">To file your&nbsp;<a href="missouri-llc-articles-of-organization.html">Missouri Articles of Organization</a>&nbsp;online, you’ll first need to create an account on the Business Registration Online Portal on the Missouri Secretary of State website. To complete your Articles, you’ll need the following information (be aware that the information you provide becomes public record):</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Company name</li>



<li>Company purpose(s). You can either list a specific purpose here or just put something to the effect of “to transact any or all lawful business for which a limited liability company may be organized under the laws of the State of Missouri.”</li>



<li>Registered agent name and address (no P.O. boxes)</li>



<li>Whether the LLC will be managed by its members or managers</li>



<li>The LLC’s duration if you don’t intend it to be perpetual. This could be a set date or a specific event that triggers the LLC’s dissolution.</li>



<li>Names and street addresses of all organizers</li>



<li>Name and address to return the filed document</li>



<li>The effective date of the LLC. If you don’t want the LLC to be created at the time of the filing, you can set a future date for the filing to take effect, up to 90 days from the time the Articles are filed.</li>



<li>Signatures of all the&nbsp;<a href="llc-organizer.html">LLC organizers</a></li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">The Articles form also asks if you want to form a Series LLC. In a Series LLC, a “parent” LLC serves as an umbrella LLC over multiple separate entities, which are shielded from each other’s liabilities. This option is available only in certain states, and Missouri is one of them.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can read more about this type of LLC on our&nbsp;<a href="series-llc-definition.html">Series LLC page</a>. However, ZenBusiness doesn’t assist with Series LLC formation at this time.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">Missouri’s Articles of Organization form has a line that reads, “The management of the limited liability company is vested in…” and asks you to choose <a href="member-managed-vs-manager-managed-llc.html">“managers” or “members.”</a> They’re asking you how you want your LLC to be governed, by the members/owners (member-managed) or by a manager (manager-managed).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Most LLCs choose to be managed by the members because they only have a few owners or just one. In those cases, it usually makes sense for the LLC owner(s) to do member-management because they’re running the business themselves. All members are sharing in running the business and making decisions for it.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">But some LLCs prefer to appoint or hire a manager instead. In the manager-managed option, one or more LLC members can be appointed to make management decisions, or someone from outside the LLC can be hired to manage the company.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Manager-management can be helpful when some of the members want only to be investors in the company as opposed to running the business and making daily decisions about it. LLCs with a lot of members also sometimes find it easier to have a manager because it’s difficult to get all the members together to make decisions on a regular basis.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Maintain your Missouri Articles of Organization information</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You only need to file your Articles of Organization once. However, if certain information in the Articles changes, such as contact information or the name and address of your registered agent, you’ll need to update your information with the state by filing&nbsp;<a href="missouri-llc-amendment.html">Missouri Articles of Amendment</a>&nbsp;and paying a filing fee.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you do need to file an amendment, we have an&nbsp;<a href="pricing-amendment.html">amendment filing service</a>&nbsp;that can handle it for you as well as our&nbsp;<a href="pricing-worry-free.html">Worry-Free Compliance service</a>, which includes two amendment filings every year.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Why would I delay my Missouri LLC filing date?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Some entrepreneurs, especially if it’s near the end of the calendar year, will delay their LLC filing date to January 1 of the coming year. This way, they can avoid the hassle and cost of having to pay taxes on an LLC in the current year. This is especially true if the future LLC owners don’t need to establish the company right away.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Ordinarily, the effective filing date would be the day the Missouri Secretary of State approves your filing. But you also have the option to tell the state that you want your effective date to be at a later time. You can choose to have your LLC’s effective date be up to 90 days past the date you submit the filing.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This is something else we can help you with. When you form your LLC in Missouri with us, we give you the option of paying an extra fee to have your LLC’s effective date delayed. (This service is only offered from October to January.)</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Keep your MO LLC’s paperwork organized</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you have us file your Articles of Organization, once the state approves your LLC, all of the relevant paperwork will be available from your ZenBusiness dashboard. There you can keep it and other important paperwork digitally organized.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll also want to keep your Articles in a safe location along with your important legal documents, your operating agreement, member certificates, contracts, compliance checklists, transfer ledger, etc. We offer a customized business kit to help you keep these important documents organized and looking professional.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Make an LLC operating agreement.</strong>&nbsp;Missouri requires all LLCs to have an operating agreement. This agreement is an internal business document that details how the business will run and much more. Though required, the document doesn’t have to be filed with the Secretary of State or any other governmental agency.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What do I include in the operating agreement?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">A good&nbsp;<a href="missouri-operating-agreement.html">Missouri operating agreement</a>&nbsp;may include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>How much ownership of the LLC each member has</li>



<li>Conduct rules and regulations for the company</li>



<li>How the LLC will be managed</li>



<li>Rights, powers, and duties of employees, members, and managers</li>



<li>Voting structure for business decisions</li>



<li>Profit allocations among members</li>



<li>Procedures for admitting or removing members</li>



<li>Procedures for dissolving the LLC and dividing its assets</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">The agreement may also include the appointment of a manager or managers and details on the scope of their authority.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group is-style-grid-full has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="apply-for-an-ein">5. Apply for an EIN</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Apply for an IRS Employer Identification Number (EIN).</strong>&nbsp;To pay your federal taxes, you’ll likely need to apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for an EIN, also known as a federal tax identification number. Think of it as a Social Security number for your LLC. It helps the IRS identify your business, and banks usually require it to open a business bank account.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can get your EIN through the IRS website, by mail, or by fax, but if you’re unfond of dealing with that particular government agency, we can get it for you. Our&nbsp;<a href="ein-number.html">EIN service</a>&nbsp;is quick and eliminates the hassle.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>✓</strong> Our LLC formation service includes obtaining an EIN for your LLC but we can also help you get an EIN for an existing company</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Register to pay Missouri taxes</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you have your EIN, you’ll need to register your business with the Missouri Department of Revenue and, if you have employees, the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Division of Employment Security. You can register online for the following:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Sales tax</li>



<li>Vendor’s use tax</li>



<li>Consumer’s use tax</li>



<li>Withholding tax</li>



<li>Unemployment tax</li>



<li>Tire and lead acid battery fee</li>



<li>Corporate income tax (if you plan to have your LLC taxed as a corporation)</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">After you’ve finished the online registration, you’ll receive a confirmation number and additional information about your registration. Processing usually takes two to three days. Keep the confirmation number for your records. For more information, contact the Missouri Department of Revenue.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Can filing as an S corp lower my taxes?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The LLC business structure gives you more flexibility than a corporation. That extends to how you can choose to have your LLC taxed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">By default, an LLC has pass-through taxation. This appeals to most owners of LLCs because it avoids “double taxation,” in which a corporation pays taxes at both the business level and again when the income is distributed to the individual owners. But some LLCs opt to be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation because, in their case, it works to their advantage.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Being taxed as a C corporation does mean you get double taxation, but, for certain LLCs, the pros can sometimes outweigh the cons. One benefit is that C corporations have the widest range of tax deductions, which could be an advantage in some scenarios, especially for more profitable LLCs. For example, some employee benefits can be written off as a business expense.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">S corp is short for “Subchapter S Corporation” and is a tax status geared toward small businesses. Having your LLC taxed as an S corp has pass-through taxation like a standard LLC, but there’s another potential advantage for some LLCs:&nbsp;<strong>It could reduce your self-employment taxes.&nbsp;</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Self-employment taxes are the portion of your taxes that pay for Social Security and Medicare. In a typical LLC, you would pay these on all of your profits.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">But filing as an S corp allows you to be an “employee-owner” and split your income into your salary and your share of the company’s profits. That way, you pay employment taxes on your salary, but not self-employment taxes on your profits. (You’ll still pay the other applicable taxes on your LLC profits, of course.)</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The drawback is that the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizes S corps more closely, meaning you’re more likely to get audited. S corps also have more restrictions for qualifying.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">While it’s possible that one of the above options could work better for your LLC, remember that business taxes are very complex and specific to your situation. That’s why you truly need to consult a tax professional to see which taxing method works best for your Missouri business.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you decide to form your LLC with an S corp status, our&nbsp;<a href="s-corporation.html">S corp service</a>&nbsp;can help you do that.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>For Employers</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you plan to hire employees, you’ll need to report all new hires to the Missouri Department of Social Services within 20 days of the hire date. You’ll also be responsible for withholding employee taxes, providing workers’ compensation insurance, and registering with the Missouri&nbsp; Department of&nbsp; Labor and&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations – Division of Employment Security for unemployment insurance tax.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Open a business bank account for your Missouri LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you’ve secured your Federal Employer Identification Number, you’ll be able to open a business bank account. Having separate accounts for your business and your personal banking is critical for sorting out your finances at tax time and helps you avoid mixing your personal assets with business assets. Having a business bank account may also allow you to get a business credit card.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">To help new business owners, we offer a&nbsp;<a href="pricing-banking.html">discounted bank account</a>&nbsp;through our partners. This allows for unlimited transactions, online banking, a debit card, and more. When you want to authorize others in your business to use the account, we offer a&nbsp;<a href="pricing-banking-resolution.html">banking resolution template</a>&nbsp;to simplify the process.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Finally, if you need further help managing your new business’s finances, try&nbsp;<a href="money.html">ZenBusiness Money</a>. It can help you create invoices, receive payments, transfer money, and manage clients all in one place.</p>

        <p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">By default, an LLC has “</span><a href="pass-through-taxation-definition.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">pass-through taxation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,” meaning that the business itself typically doesn’t pay federal income tax on its profits. Instead, the responsibility to pay income taxes falls only on the individual business owner or owners. In a typical corporation, profits are taxed at both the business level </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> the individual owners’ level.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">A single-member LLC doesn’t have to file a separate federal return for the LLC. The member reports the LLC income on their personal income tax return (Form 1040). But LLCs with more than one member must file a separate information federal return for the LLC, Form 1065. Then each LLC member reports their share of the profits on Schedule K-1 and attaches it to their own personal federal tax return.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though an LLCs is taxed as a sole proprietorship or general partnership by default, LLC owners also have the option to tax the business as a corporation. Some LLC owners choose to classify their businesses as an S corporation or a C corporation, which can be advantageous in some cases.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Some LLCs elect to be taxed as S corporations because it can save the members money on self-employment taxes. S corporations also have pass-through taxation like a typical LLC. You can learn more on our </span><a href="what-is-an-s-corporation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What Is an S Corp?”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> page.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">In some cases, LLC members may be willing to accept a double taxation burden in exchange for the other possible benefits of being taxed as a C corporation. For example, C corporations also have the widest range of possible tax deductions, including the ability to deduct employee benefits.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">You also have a few other forms of federal taxation to keep in mind. For example, you will likely need to pay self-employment taxes on your portion of the LLC’s profits. These are the taxes that go toward Social Security and Medicare. Fortunately, an LLC member can deduct half of the self-employment taxes paid as a business expense.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><b>Missouri Business Taxes</b></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have your LLC taxed as a pass-through entity for federal income tax, Missouri will tax you in the same manner for state income tax. However, if you choose to be taxed as a corporation, your LLC will have to pay any applicable Missouri corporate taxes.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">We listed many of the possible state taxes you could be responsible for in Step 5, but this isn’t a comprehensive list. Check the Missouri Department of Revenue website for more information on all your state tax obligations.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><b>Local Taxes</b></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to federal and state taxes, you may owe taxes to your county, municipalities, and other tax districts. You’ll need to check with your local tax authorities to make sure you’re paying all the taxes you owe.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, we don’t need to tell you that taxes can get </span><span style="font-weight: 400">very</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> complicated, more so at the business level. We </span><strong>strongly</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> recommend consulting a tax professional about your specific business’s circumstances.
