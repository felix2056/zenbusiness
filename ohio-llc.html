This may include a vendor&#039;s license for selling tangible personal items or offering taxable services. The Ohio Department of Taxation handles vendor&#039;s licenses. Our business license report service can assist in identifying the necessary licenses and permits for your Ohio LLC."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does it cost to start an LLC in Ohio?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The cost of starting an LLC in Ohio can vary. The filing fee for Articles of Organization is $99. Additional costs for trademarks, licenses, and permits may apply. Prices and requirements can change, so it&#039;s essential to stay updated on Ohio&#039;s business formation requirements."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the benefits of an LLC in Ohio?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The benefits of forming an LLC in Ohio include avoiding double taxation, operational flexibility, asset protection, and reduced reporting requirements compared to corporations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is an LLC taxed in Ohio?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Ohio LLCs are typically taxed as pass-through entities, meaning the business itself does not pay federal income tax. Instead, the income passes through to the LLC owners, who report it on their personal tax returns. LLC owners can also choose to be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation. State income taxes follow a similar pass-through structure, unless the LLC chooses corporate taxation. Other state taxes that may apply include the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) and sales and use taxes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the processing time to form my Ohio LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The estimated processing time for filing Articles of Organization in Ohio is three to seven business days. Expedited services are available with faster processing times. Check Ohio&#039;s official website for detailed information on expedited processing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to file my operating agreement with the state of Ohio?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, Ohio does not require LLC owners to file an operating agreement with the state. However, having an operating agreement is beneficial for internal record-keeping and organization."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What tax structure should I choose for my LLC in Ohio?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Many LLC owners opt for a pass-through taxation structure, where the business&#039;s income is reported on the owners&#039; personal tax returns. Choosing C corporation status may lead to double taxation, while S corporation status retains pass-through treatment and may provide additional tax benefits. Consulting with a licensed tax professional is recommended for making the best decision for your LLC."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Ohio allow a Series LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Ohio permits the formation of Series LLCs, where multiple LLCs operate under one parent LLC. Each company retains its own rights, assets, and liabilities."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I dissolve my Ohio LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To dissolve an Ohio LLC, file a Certificate of Dissolution (Form 616) with the Secretary of State. You may include a notice of the dissolution to creditors and claimants to address any business debts. Refer to our Ohio business dissolution guide for further details."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I transfer ownership of an LLC in Ohio?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The process of transferring ownership of an Ohio LLC may be outlined in the operating agreement. It can involve a full or partial sale of the company or handling the transfer when a member passes away. Filing a Certificate of Amendment or Restatement (Form 611) with the Ohio Secretary of State is required to update the member status."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I remove a member from my Ohio LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To remove a member from an Ohio LLC, ensure that the reasons for removal align with the operating agreement. Decide how the member&#039;s ownership interests will be handled. File a Certificate of Amendment or Restatement (Form 611) with the Ohio Secretary of State to reflect the changes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need a business plan for my LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Ohio does not require a business plan during the formation process.

If so, are you looking to start a <strong>limited liability company (LLC)? Ohio</strong> might just be a great location for your idea to prosper. A 2021 CNBC ranking for “America’s Top States for Business” placed Ohio in the top 10 list. Mix that with the business-friendly LLC model, and you might find the success you’ve always wanted. </p>


<p class="txt-body-md">One thing that holds many potential business owners back from moving forward, though, is the business formation process. It can be a lot like dreading the state’s infamous winter weather. The good news is that our business formation services are specifically designed to make the process of starting your LLC in Ohio easier.</p>

These include choosing the right business name, appointing a statutory agent, filing Articles of Organization with the state, and more. We’ll be going into more detail about these and other steps in the guide. </p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You should know that this guide is for starting a <strong>domestic, for-profit LLC in Ohio</strong>. If you’re looking to start a foreign LLC, then you’ll need to file Form 617 with the state’s Secretary of State. The process for doing that is slightly different from the guide below. </p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>You’ll start by&nbsp;<a href="business-name-checker.html">finding a name for your Ohio LLC</a>.&nbsp;</strong>There are so many businesses out there, and many may be in the same industry you want to join. Start your business with a unique name, that will surely differentiate you from them. Not only does it have to be unique, but it also has to follow the naming rules that Ohio has set for businesses.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Naming Requirements for Ohio LLCs</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Ohio has several naming rules for businesses. The information we’ve provided below is a general breakdown of the much more detailed rules that you can find on the Secretary of State’s “Guide to Name Availability” page. There, you’ll find more rules concerning punctuation, contractions, abbreviations, tenses, and more.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">General Ohio LLC Naming Rules</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Under Ohio law, your business’s name must be distinguishable from the names of other companies previously registered with the Secretary of State. These include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Other LLCs</li>



<li>Limited liability partnerships (LLPs)</li>



<li>Limited partnerships (LPs)</li>



<li>Domestic corporations</li>



<li>Licensed foreign corporations</li>



<li>Trade names</li>



<li>Reserved names</li>



<li>Some business names can be subject to additional naming requirements/restrictions. For example, if a business plans to use the word “trust,” “bank,” “banking,” or something similar in its name, it must have approval by the Ohio Department of Commerce – Division of Financial Institutions before filing its Articles of Organization.</li>



<li>The business name cannot contain words that are considered profane. It also cannot contain phrases that are considered slurs against ethnic groups, genders, religions, or heredity.</li>



<li>The business name cannot imply an affiliation with a government agency. For example, a business cannot have “F.B.I.” in its name if it’s unaffiliated with that agency.</li>



<li>The business name must have a designator identifying its business structure. For an LLC, appropriate designators would be:<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Limited liability company</li>



<li>L.L.C.</li>



<li>LLC</li>



<li>Limited</li>



<li>Ltd.</li>



<li>Ltd</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">How do you go about checking if the name you want is free to use? You can check out our&nbsp;<a href="ohio-business-search.html">Ohio Business Entity Search page</a>&nbsp;for instructions on how to conduct a search for yourself. Keep in mind that name search engines aren’t perfect. You can double-check to make sure your name is available by contacting the Secretary of State at (614) 466-0562.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-reserving-an-ohio-business-name">Reserving an Ohio Business Name</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you’ve decided on the perfect name and it’s available, consider reserving it. This way, no one else will be able to claim it. You can do this by using our&nbsp;<a href="reserve-business-name.html">name reservation service</a>. It’ll reserve your name for 180 days. During that time, you can focus on setting up your LLC.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Get a domain name for your LLC in Ohio</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">While you’re deciding on a name for your Ohio LLC, consider picking one that also works as a domain name. Having an online presence in the digital age is a must for businesses, and a domain name can help you reach people outside of your brick-and-mortar location (if your business isn’t strictly online-based).</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Is your Ohio LLC name available as a web domain?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">One thing to consider when deciding on a name for your LLC in Ohio is its availability as a web domain. Finding a name that can also be used as a URL means having a business website where customers and clients can find you online.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Check out our&nbsp;<a href="business-name-checker.html">domain name search tool</a>&nbsp;and find out if the business name you want is available to use as a URL. If it is, then you may want to get it before anyone else does. That way, you can extend your reach and serve customers outside of your physical location. This can also offer an extra marketing advantage since you can promote your business through social media via your business website.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We offer a&nbsp;<a href="domain-registration.html">domain name service</a>&nbsp;that can help you find and buy a domain name. We can also help you put together a&nbsp;<a href="webpage.html">business website</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="get-domain.html">domain name privacy</a>.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Trademarking Your Ohio LLC’s Name</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You should know that, even if it appears that the name you want is clear for the taking, that doesn’t necessarily mean you can. Business names can be trademarked, so you’ll need to make sure that the one you want is 100% available.&nbsp;<a href="how-register-trademark.html">Trademarking</a>&nbsp;a business name isn’t required, but it can add additional protection that prevents other businesses from using it.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can do so at the state and federal levels. For Ohio trademarks, you’ll need to submit Form 555 with the Ohio Secretary of State. For federal trademarks, visit the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website to conduct a search.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-filing-for-a-trade-name-or-fictitious-name-in-ohio">Filing for a “Trade Name” or “Fictitious Name” in Ohio</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’re free to do business under your LLC’s legal name, but you also have the option to use a different name. This is where a “fictitious name” or a “trade name” comes into play. In some other states, this option is known as a&nbsp;<a href="ohio-dba.html">“doing business as” (DBA) name</a>.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Trade names need to be distinguishable from other Ohio company names, so you’ll have to conduct another name search. A fictitious name, on the other hand, doesn’t require this. This means that trade names can provide greater protection. You can learn more about trade names and fictitious names in Ohio by checking out Section 1329.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Appoint a&nbsp;<a href="ohio-statutory-agent.html">statutory agent for your Ohio LLC</a>.&nbsp;</strong>The state requires all businesses to have a statutory agent, commonly known as a registered agent in some other states. This person or entity accepts any legal documents in person on behalf of the LLC in Ohio and relays them to the LLC’s leadership.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This agent must be available at a physical address, known as a registered office, in Ohio during regular business hours. You’ll need to appoint a statutory agent for your LLC in Ohio when filing the Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State.&nbsp;<strong>When filing, you’ll need to include a written acceptance signed by the agent along with the agent’s name and address.</strong></p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Who can be a statutory agent for an LLC in Ohio?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Ohio has requirements for who can serve as a statutory agent. They include one of the following:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>A natural person who is a resident of Ohio.</li>



<li>One of these entities with a business address in Ohio:<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Limited liability company</li>



<li>Limited liability partnership</li>



<li>Limited partnership</li>



<li>Limited partnership association (LPA)</li>



<li>Professional association (PA)</li>



<li>Partnership</li>



<li>Domestic or foreign corporation</li>



<li>Nonprofit corporation</li>



<li>Unincorporated nonprofit association (UNA)</li>



<li>Business trust</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">What if my statutory agent resigns?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your LLC must maintain a statutory agent. If yours happens to resign, then you’ll need to file some paperwork with the Ohio Secretary of State. A form called “Statutory Agent Update” (Form 521) will need to be filed if your statutory agent resigns, dies, or is no longer able to perform their duty.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This form will also need to be submitted if your current statutory agent changes their name and/or address. Failing to file this form if any change to your statutory agent occurs can have some repercussions. The LLC’s Articles of Organization may be canceled and other issues can come up.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Can I be my own statutory agent?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Yes, you can be your own statutory agent in Ohio. If you’re considering this, you should also consider some downsides that may make you rethink things:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The statutory agent must be available at their registered address during regular business hours. This means that you’ll have difficulty going out to run errands, taking a sick day, meeting clients, etc.</li>



<li>If you’re served with the notice of a lawsuit, then it’ll be given to you in person at the LLC, potentially making you look bad in front of clients and customers.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">ZenBusiness can provide your statutory agent</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Our registered agent service will provide you with a statutory agent who will receive important legal documents and notices on your behalf. This service keeps your business compliant by ensuring that you have a statutory agent at all times for your LLC.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">What makes the service great is that you won’t have to worry about performing the duties of this agent, meaning you’re free to run the business without being anchored to your office. You can run errands, meet customers and clients, and run your business your way.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This service also keeps documents issued to your LLC organized. They’ll be ready to view, download, and print through your ZenBusiness customer dashboard.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">“How fast can I form my Ohio LLC?” you may ask.&nbsp;If you’re ready to launch and don’t want to wait weeks for your paperwork to get processed, we can help. You can form your LLC in Ohio in as little as one day with our&nbsp;<a href="pricing-formation-speeds.html">rush filing services</a>. With our rush filing service, we prioritize your formation paperwork so you can get it filed with the Ohio Secretary of State within 1-3 business day for just $100 + state fees.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The Secretary of State usually processes within three to seven days depending on the volume of other filings. The good news is that it offers expedited service. It comes in three levels:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Level 1 can be submitted online, in person, or by mail for a $100 fee for a turnaround time of two days.</li>



<li>Level 2 can only be submitted in person or online for a $200 fee for a turnaround time of one business day.</li>



<li>Level 3 can only be submitted in person or online for a $300 fee for a turnaround time of four hours. For this option, filings that are submitted after 1 p.m. will be available the following business day.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">When does my LLC’s formation become effective?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">According to Ohio Revised Code Section 1706.16(D), “A limited liability company is formed when the Articles of Organization are filed by the Ohio Secretary of State or at any later date or time specified in the document.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Additionally, 1706.172(D) states that an LLC’s Articles of Organization can specify an effective time and a delayed effective date not exceeding 90 days following the date the Ohio Secretary of State receives the Articles.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Information Needed for Ohio Articles of Organization</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">When filing your Articles of Organization, you’ll need to include some important information per Ohio Code Section 1706.16. The form details what to include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The LLC’s name, which must include one of the designators mentioned in Step 1.</li>



<li>The statutory agent’s information (name and address) as well as their acceptance of appointment.</li>



<li>A statement showing that the LLC may have one or more series of assets subject to limitations, if applicable. This reflects division (B)(3) of section 1706.761 of the Ohio Revised Code.</li>



<li>Any other important matters that the&nbsp;<a href="llc-organizer.html">organizers</a>&nbsp;or members feel are important to include in the Articles of Organization.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">The Articles can also additionally include the LLC’s effective date and time (if different from the filing date) and the company’s purpose. Keep in mind that if you need to&nbsp;<a href="ohio-llc-amendment.html">make any changes to the Articles</a>&nbsp;in the future, then you’ll need to file an Ohio Certificate of Amendment or Restatement (Form 611).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We offer an&nbsp;<a href="pricing-amendment.html">amendment filing service</a>&nbsp;that can take care of this for you, too. You should also check out our&nbsp;<a href="pricing-worry-free.html">Worry-Free Compliance service</a>. It includes two amendment filings every year.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Member-Managed or Manager-Managed?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Ohio is in a unique spot when it comes to <a href="member-managed-vs-manager-managed-llc.html">member-managed and manager-managed</a> LLCs. A member-managed LLC is governed by the members. A manager-managed LLC is governed by a manager. Deciding which structure would be chosen would normally be laid out in the operating agreement. However, the Ohio Revised Limited Liability Company Act passed in February of 2022 changed the rules.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">According to the Secretary of State’s website, “The new LLC Act eliminates the distinction between member-managed and manager-managed limited liability companies. A person’s ability to act as an agent, and bind the limited liability company, can be authorized by either the operating agreement; decisions of members in accordance with the operating agreement; a Statement of Authority (Form 613) filed with the Ohio Secretary of State’s office; or the LLC Act’s default rules.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In other words, an LLC’s leadership is free to choose a management structure that works best for them, whether that structure follows the previous act or incorporates other governance mechanisms. This must be included in the OA.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Keep track of your business documents</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you choose us to file your Ohio Articles of Organization, then your paperwork will be ready and available to view on your ZenBusiness dashboard when it’s approved.

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Create an&nbsp;<a href="ohio-operating-agreement.html">operating agreement for your Ohio LLC</a>&nbsp;detailing how the company will be organized and run.</strong>&nbsp;This document isn’t required for filing in Ohio, but drafting one can provide several benefits that could help you run your Ohio LLC smoothly in the future.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-benefits-of-an-ohio-llc-operating-agreement">Benefits of an Ohio LLC Operating Agreement</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">We know that dealing with business documents isn’t fun, but to help your business run well, consider an OA. Here are some benefits:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Operating agreements enhance the LLC’s liability status, allowing you to clarify which assets are personal and which are business.</li>



<li>It clarifies any verbal agreements between the members/managers. Consider getting agreements in writing and keeping them organized in your OA.</li>



<li>It allows you to run the limited liability company however you want so long as no laws are being broken.</li>



<li>It further legitimizes the LLC, making it look much more organized, planned out, and professionally run.</li>



<li>Operating agreements can make it easier to get a loan since financial institutions sometimes require them.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">What should I include in my Ohio LLC’s operating agreement?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can include pretty much whatever you want in your Operating agreements. Some basic items include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Why the limited liability company is being formed and which services/products it will offer.</li>



<li>The names of the members.</li>



<li>The contributions to be made by each member.</li>



<li>The ownership interest of each member as well as division of profits and losses.</li>



<li>Each member’s voting rights when it comes to business-related matters.</li>



<li>Detailing how new members will be added to the limited liability company.</li>



<li>Detailing the reasons for and process of removing a member from the LLC.</li>



<li>Organizing meetings, if any.</li>



<li>The reasons for and process of dissolving the LLC.</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">After the LLC operating agreement is drafted and all members agree to it, it should be signed by everyone. Our&nbsp;<a href="operating-agreement.html">OA template</a>&nbsp;can help you get started if you aren’t sure how to create one.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Do I need an LLC operating agreement even if I’m the only owner?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Since an operating agreement mostly aims to detail how the LLC will be run, it may seem pointless to have one if you’re the only owner, right? Well, an OA may still be of great benefit to a single owner. Potential investors, banks, future business partners, and others will probably want to see your OA to ensure that you’re serious about running the company.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Banks, for example, sometimes request an OA before opening a business bank account or granting a loan. The OA can also be used to stipulate what will happen to your limited liability company if you become incapacitated or die. And if you’re taken to court, the OA can be used to show that you and the business are different entities, thereby protecting your personal assets.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) to register your LLC with the federal government.</strong>&nbsp;An EIN is also known as a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) and Federal Tax Identification Number. An EIN is like a Social Security number for your business. It allows you to pay taxes, hire employees, apply for a business bank account and a business credit card.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can get one on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website or&nbsp;<a href="ein-number.html">with us</a>.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-register-for-llc-for-business-taxes-in-ohio">Register for LLC for Business Taxes in Ohio</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll need to register with the Ohio Business Gateway website. Here, you can find filings for the Department of Taxation, which includes the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT), Employer Withholding, local sales tax and more.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Additionally, you can visit the Ohio Department of Taxation website to obtain important information regarding the state’s taxes. This includes registration requirements, filing due dates, and filing requirements. You can also take advantage of the Ohio Small Business Tax Training Program to help you better understand the Ohio department state’s tax requirements. It pays to learn about sales tax.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Can filing as an S corp lower my taxes?</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">We should point out that an S corporation is not a business structure like an LLC. It’s simply a tax designation that an LLC can apply for. If an LLC only has one member, it’ll be taxed as a sole proprietorship. If it has two or more members, it’ll be taxed as a partnership.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Entrepreneurs find LLCs appealing because they avoid “double taxation.” This means paying taxes at the business and individual levels. As great as this is, an LLC can apply for S corp status to additionally save money on self-employment taxes.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">As an “employee-owner,” you can divide your income into your salary and the share you hold of the company’s profits. You’ll then only have to pay self-employment taxes on your salary and not your profits.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Keep in mind that the IRS watches S corps more closely, meaning you could be at a higher risk of an audit. S corp status is also harder to qualify for.&nbsp;<strong>You should also know that we can help LLCs apply for S corp status only during formations.&nbsp;</strong>If you already own an LLC, then you’ll need to apply for this status on your own. Speak with a licensed tax professional.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin" id="h-open-a-business-bank-account-using-your-ein">Open a business bank account using your EIN</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Aftering securing an EIN, you’ll have the opportunity to open a business bank account. Consider getting one since having separate accounts for your personal and business needs is important for sorting your finances when tax season rolls around.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Mixing your business and personal finances with a single account can be used against you if you’re ever taken to court. It might be argued that you and your LLC aren’t separate entities. With a business bank account, you can avoid this.</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">It avoids “double taxation.” This means that you’ll only have to pay personal taxes rather than both personal and corporate taxes. </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">It offers asset protection. The LLC model can protect your personal assets from business debts and legal liability. </span></li>

        <p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLCs avoid “double taxation,” meaning that the business isn’t required to pay federal income tax. Instead, the income passes through to the LLC owners. Each owner will then pay taxes on the company’s earnings as regular income. This structure differs from corporations, where the company’s profits are taxed twice at the business level and shareholder level. </span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">The IRS also taxes LLC owners based on their share in the LLC. For example, if an owner owns 20% of the business, then they’ll be taxed 20% of the business’s earnings. </span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLCs can also opt to be taxed as a </span><a href="incorporate.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">C corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> or an </span><a href="what-is-an-s-corporation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">S corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. C corp status carries the double taxation clause. S corp status, however, avoids it. Plus, LLC owners can save more in self-employment taxes with an S corp status. Keep in mind that S corp status catches more attention from the IRS and has more restrictions. </span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">The good news is that we can help you apply for </span><a href="s-corporation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">S corp status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><b>This is only possible during your LLCs formation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> If you already own an LLC, then you’ll need to request S corp status on your own with the IRS. Speak with a licensed tax professional for more information. </span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the state income tax, Ohio taxes LLCs as pass-through entities unless the company chooses to be taxed as a corporation. A few other state taxes that may be imposed on your LLC include the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) and sales and use taxes. </span></p>
