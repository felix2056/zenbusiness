For example, Orleans Parish requires occupational or general business licenses for businesses operating in the area. Additional permits and licenses may be needed for specific activities and zoning compliance. Our Business License Report Service can assist in identifying all licensing obligations for your business at all government levels."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does an LLC cost in Louisiana?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The base fee for filing LLC Articles of Organization and the Initial Report in Louisiana is $100, with an additional $25 for reserving a business name. Other fees may apply for expedited filing and required licenses and permits. Note that filing fees are subject to change, so it&#039;s advisable to check the SOS website for the most up-to-date information."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the benefits of an LLC in Louisiana?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Forming an LLC in Louisiana provides personal liability protection without facing double taxation as corporations do. In case of lawsuits or debts, personal finances and property are usually protected from liabilities. State and federal income taxes are paid only at the member level, avoiding entity-level taxes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is an LLC taxed in Louisiana?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Louisiana LLCs generally have pass-through taxation, meaning members pay income taxes only at the individual level based on their share of the revenue. LLCs can also choose to be taxed as C corporations, which may offer more deductions, or as S corporations for more flexible self-employment tax options while retaining pass-through taxation. Seeking advice from a tax professional is recommended for determining the best tax structure for your LLC."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the processing time to form my Louisiana LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The processing time for forming a Louisiana LLC can take multiple days, but paying an additional filing fee to the SOS can expedite the process, resulting in same-day or few-hours processing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to file my LLC operating agreement with the state of Louisiana?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, the LLC operating agreement does not need to be filed with the state. It is an internal document for the LLC and should be kept along with other legal documents."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What tax structure should I choose for my Louisiana LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The most suitable tax structure for a Louisiana LLC depends on specific business needs and circumstances. Options include pass-through taxation for LLCs and S corporations, or taxation as a C corporation for broader deductions. Consulting with a tax professional is essential for making an informed decision."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Louisiana allow a series LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, Louisiana does not allow the formation of a series LLC."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I dissolve my Louisiana LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To dissolve a Louisiana LLC, majority approval from the members or following the procedures in the operating agreement is necessary. After obtaining approval, a notice of dissolution may need to be published in a newspaper. The process requires filing an Affidavit to Dissolve Limited Liability Company with the Secretary of State and addressing winding up tasks such as liquidating assets and settling debts and liabilities."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I transfer ownership of an LLC in Louisiana?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Ownership transfer of a Louisiana LLC requires unanimous consent from the members or following the procedures in the operating agreement. Updating internal and public business documents, including filing a Notice of Change of Members of a Limited Liability Company with the Secretary of State, is necessary after the transfer of ownership."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a trade name be assigned to an LLC in Louisiana?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, you can apply for an LLC trade name through the Secretary of State."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I remove a member from an LLC in Louisiana?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A member can be removed by a vote of the members or by following the procedures in the operating agreement. Handling the departing member&#039;s distributions and filing change of ownership paperwork with the Secretary of State are important steps in the process."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to file an annual report for my Louisiana LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, an annual report and filing fee must be submitted to the Secretary of State each year to keep the Louisiana LLC in good standing. Failure to comply may result in the revocation of the LLC&#039;s Articles of Organization. Our Annual Report Service can help ensure compliance with this requirement."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need a business plan for my LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A business plan is not a legal requirement, but it is highly recommended. A well-structured business plan can include market research, budgets, financing needs, and product details, making it easier to secure funding or resources from investors and financial institutions."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the Louisiana publication requirement?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"There is no publication requirement to start an LLC in Louisiana. However, a publication requirement may apply when closing an LLC through a Notice of Dissolution filing. If a Notice of Dissolution is filed, winding up/liquidation notice must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the same parish as the LLC&#039;s registered office, and a copy of the notice and the publisher&#039;s affidavit must be submitted to the Secretary of State."}}]},{"@type":"HowTo","@id":"https://www.zenbusiness.com/louisiana-llc/#CollectionPage_HowTo","description":"Create a Louisiana LLC in five steps, from naming an LLC in LA to applying for an EIN.

        </div>
</div></div>


<p class="txt-body-md">Louisiana attracts people from around the world with its music, food, culture, and, of course, Mardi Gras. And where you have people, you have business opportunities. A great way to capitalize on those opportunities in the Pelican State is to start a <strong>Louisiana LLC</strong>.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">A <strong>limited liability company</strong> (LLC) is a popular type of business entity because it combines the <strong>tax benefits</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong> of a sole proprietorship with the <strong>liability protection</strong> of a corporation. In most cases, the owners of an LLC (who are called “members”) and their personal assets are protected from the liabilities and debts of the business.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><p class="txt-body-md">But starting a Louisana LLC isn’t necessarily a king cake walk. Louisiana offers a lot of wonderful things to its residents, but it also offers an excessive amount of red tape.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">That’s where we come in. In this article, we’ll show you how to get an LLC in Louisiana, and we’ll also point you to some of our services that can make the whole process a lot easier.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Before we get started, we want to let you know that this guide is for only domestic (in-state), for-profit LLCs. If you want to start a foreign (out-of-state) LLC, a low-profit LLC, a corporation, a foreign corporation, or some other business entity, you may need to follow different steps that we don’t cover in this article. But if you’re ready to form a domestic LLC in Louisiana, you’re in the right place.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">LLC requirements vary state by state so it’s important that you are well-versed in Louisiana laws before proceeding. Generally, it comes down to these steps:</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-md zb-default-margin" id="h-starting-an-llc-in-louisiana">Starting an LLC in Louisiana</h2>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you want to create an LLC in Louisiana, you have to get comfortable with paperwork. You’ll need to submit initial paperwork to register your LLC with the Louisiana Secretary of State (SOS), and you’ll need to submit reports to the SOS on a yearly basis. Your paperwork helps the state keep track of your business and make sure it’s in line with the law. Your registration paperwork also helps potential patrons confirm your business’s existence and good standing.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">There’s plenty of preparation work to do before you form your LLC. This preparation work includes choosing a name for your LLC, appointing a Louisiana registered agent, and filing Articles of Organization and an Initial Report with the Louisiana Secretary of State.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">What we’ve mentioned thus far sounds like a lot, but don’t worry. We’re about to break down starting an LLC in Louisiana step by step. These steps can help you whether you’re setting up shop in the bayou or negotiating deals in the French Quarter. And once you’re ready to start, we have multiple services to make the process much easier than doing it alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Begin by </strong><a href="how-to-name-your-llc.html"><strong>giving your LLC a name</strong></a><strong>.</strong> When you start an LLC in Louisiana, you have to let the government and the public know who you are. Your LLC’s name must go on your business formation paperwork before you submit it.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">When choosing a name, your LLC must comply with Louisiana naming rules for LLCs. Otherwise, your Louisiana LLC filing will be rejected.&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Official Naming Requirements for Louisiana LLCs</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Let’s start with the rules you must follow when naming a Louisiana LLC. Your official LLC name must comply with the following:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The name must be different from the other entity names on record with the Louisiana SOS. To cut down on the likelihood of choosing a duplicate name before you file, take a look at our <a href="louisiana-business-search.html">Louisiana Business Entity Search</a> page.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The name must contain a “designator” indicating that the business is an LLC. You can choose from the following: “limited liability company” or the initials “L.L.C.,” “LLC,” “LC,” or “L.C.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>The name can’t contain words that indicate an unlawful purpose or a purpose that’s against your LLC’s Articles of Organization.</li>



<li>The name can’t contain the phrase “doing business as” or the initials “d/b/a.”</li>



<li>The name can’t imply that your LLC is a local, state, or federal government agency.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The name can’t have words or phrases that are considered deceptive, immoral, or scandalous.</li>



<li>The name cannot use the words or derivatives of the words “engineer,” “engineering,” “surveyor,” or “surveying,” and it can’t use the words “insurance,” “bank,” “banker,” “banking,” “savings,” “safe deposit,” “trust,” “trustee,” “building and loan,” “homestead,” or “credit union” unless your LLC fulfills specific requirements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">For a complete list of Louisiana naming rules, see Louisiana RS §12:1306. Despite these regulations, you still have plenty of freedom to be creative when naming your new venture.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Reserve a business name in Louisiana</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you have a business name you like, most states give you the option to reserve it for a set amount of time for a small fee. This is ideal if you’ve found the perfect name but aren’t quite ready to file the rest of your LLC paperwork.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Louisiana is different, though. If you’re filing online, you’re required to reserve your name before completing your Articles of Organization. You’ll do this through “geauxBIZ,” Louisiana’s online system for registering new businesses.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You’ll first need to create a geauxBIZ account. From there, you’ll follow the online instructions to reserve a business name. The reservation is good for 120 days and costs a small fee. The reservation can be expedited for an additional fee.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The upside to this is that this system allows you to know for certain that your desired LLC name is available before you file your Articles of Organization, thus eliminating the possibility of the filing being rejected for having an unacceptable name.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Before you make a final decision on your business name, though, you still have more factors to consider.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Getting a Domain Name</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Few things happen today without the internet. The success of your business can hang on an attractive and easy-to-find website. If your domain name doesn’t mesh well with your LLC’s name, patrons will likely have trouble finding you online, and that means less money. These are factors to think about when naming your business and choosing available domains.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Is your Louisiana LLC name available as a web domain?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your LLC’s online presence is vital. That’s why you want to make sure that you choose an LLC name that matches an available domain name for your business. If there’s no connection between your domain name and your official name, you’re likely to have patrons who either can’t find you online or can’t find your storefront.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">What’s the best way to make sure that you have a good domain name and official LLC name combination ready for your business? Preparation is key. We can help you prepare with our <a href="business-name-checker.html">Domain Name Search Tool</a>. Once you find a good name, our <a href="domain-registration.html">domain name</a> service can help you secure your domain name. We can also help you <a href="webpage.html">build your business’s website</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Federal and State Trademarks</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Even if the SOS approves your business name, that’s no guarantee that someone else hasn’t already claimed it with a federal or state trademark. To truly check to see if your business name isn’t trademarked is difficult because there’s no one central place to check. Some businesses even employ an attorney specializing in trademarks to see if they’re in the clear.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can take some measures yourself, like searching the trademark database on the United States Patent and Trademark Office website. This can help you determine if someone’s already claimed a federal trademark on the name you want.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">State trademarks are applicable only within the borders of a state. To find out if your desired name has been trademarked at the state level, contact the Louisiana SOS. If you want, you can also apply for your own state trademark.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to checking these databases, it’s wise to do extensive internet searches for your business name, including checking domain names, social media sites, and even phone directories.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Filing for a Trade Name in Louisiana</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your LLC can have only one official name, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use multiple names for your business. Multiple names can help you market your LLC’s different products and services separately.&nbsp;Any business name you use that’s different from your official business name is a “doing business as” (DBA) name. Louisiana calls a DBA a “<a href="louisiana-dba.html">trade name</a>,” and you need to register your trade names with the SOS.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="appoint-a-registered-agent-in-louisiana">Step 2:&nbsp;Appoint a registered agent in Louisiana</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>You must select a <a href="louisiana-registered-agent.html">Louisiana registered agent</a> for your LLC.</strong> In fact, you must name your registered agent on your LLC formation documents.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">So what does a registered agent do? A registered agent, also known as an agent for service of process, is responsible for receiving service of process and other official notices for your LLC. Your registered agent must always be available at your LLC’s registered office in Louisiana during normal business hours. The registered office must be a physical address in Louisiana and not a P.O. box mailing address because some notices need to be delivered in person.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Who can be a registered agent in Louisiana?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your registered agent must be a Louisiana citizen and resident or a company authorized to conduct business in Louisiana. If you choose a business to be your registered agent, that business’s governing documents have to authorize its registered agent role. A business that acts as a registered agent must also identify two people at its address who can fulfill the registered agent duties.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The registered agent must accept their appointment in a signed and notarized statement on your formation documents. If filing online, the registered agent must consent to the appointment within seven days.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What if a process server can’t find my registered agent?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Some business owners think that serving as their own registered agent is the simplest way to meet Louisiana’s agent requirement. But consider what could happen if a process server is unable to find you.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This can occur if you aren’t in the office (for example, out of town, on vacation, sick, etc.) when someone needs to reach the agent. It can also happen if you move and forget to update your paperwork with the state.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to legal penalties for being out of compliance, failing to maintain an agent could mean that a process server can’t find you to notify you of a lawsuit. In that scenario, a court case against you could go forward without your knowledge, meaning you wouldn’t even have a chance to defend yourself.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Should I be my own registered agent?&nbsp;</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The choice is yours, but being your own registered agent often leads to more complications than it’s worth.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">One drawback of being your own registered agent is the increased likelihood of receiving embarrassing legal documents in front of patrons. Not only can this be humiliating, but it might also damage confidence in your business. Using a separate registered agent at another location can help you avoid these risks.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Another drawback to being your own registered agent is that it takes the flexibility out of your day. Registered agents need to be constantly present at the registered office during normal business hours.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’re tethered to the office, this means you have less time to take business meetings, attend working events, scope out opportunities, etc. A separate registered agent frees you from this responsibility.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Consider using a registered agent service for your LA LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Does having a separate registered agent sound good to you? Are you unsure where you can find a registered agent that suits your needs? Well, you can look to us. Our <a href="registered-agent.html">Registered Agent Service</a> helps you locate and appoint a registered agent that meets your LLC’s needs and fulfills your legal obligations.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>To start your LLC, file Articles of Organization and an Initial Report with the Louisiana Secretary of State.</strong> Once you pay the accompanying filing fee and the state approves these documents, your LLC will be official.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’re nervous about filing your formation documents correctly, we can do it for you. <a href="pricing-business-filing.html">Our Business Formation Service</a> files the proper LLC formation paperwork on your behalf. With the time and worry you save using our professional services, you can focus on putting the other pieces of your business together for opening day.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Although we have you covered, let’s go over the basic filing steps below.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">As we mentioned, Louisiana’s filing process is considerably more complex than most states. For starters, not all parishes have the same filing options. If you’re starting your LLC in any of the following parishes, you’re required to do an online filing through the geauxBIZ system: Ascension, Bossier, Caddo, Calcasieu, East Baton Rouge, Jefferson, Lafayette, Livingston, Orleans, Ouachita, Rapides, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, or Terrebonne.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’re not in one of the parishes listed above, you also have the option of filing by postal mail. However, you’ll need to have both the Articles of Organization and the Initial Report notarized if you go that route. You’ll also need your registered agent to sign the Initial Report.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Filing by mail is slower, but Louisiana does give you the option to have your filing processed in 24 hours for an extra fee or in two to four hours for a higher fee.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Filing with geauxBIZ</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Filing online is generally faster than mail, but the geauxBIZ system can be more confusing. One reason for this is that the system also wants you to register with the Louisiana Workforce Commission (if you have employees) and the Louisiana Department of Revenue at the same time you’re filing the Articles of Organization.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The reason this can be so problematic is that, although the SOS doesn’t ask for it, the Louisiana Department of Revenue may ask for your Employer Identification Number (EIN). This is a federal number you get from the IRS for the purpose of paying taxes, hiring employees, etc.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Other states don’t require you to have your EIN until after your LLC is approved by the state, which eliminates the problem of getting an EIN only to have your LLC possibly rejected by the state. But, Louisiana is different, so you may have to have your EIN before you start the process with geauzBIZ. We cover getting an EIN later in Step 5.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The other issue with geauzBIZ is that you might be faced with a lot of questions you don’t yet know how to answer without the advice of an accountant. Plus, as we mentioned in Step 1, you’re required to reserve your business name when filing online.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Information Needed for Louisiana Articles of Organization</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Here’s a quick roundup of the information you’ll need to provide in your <a href="louisiana-llc-articles-of-organization.html">Louisiana Articles of Organization</a>. Bear in mind that, once submitted, this information becomes public knowledge.</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Your LLC’s official name</li>



<li>Your LLC’s purpose (if you want some flexibility, you can say its purpose is to engage in any activities that are lawful for LLCs)</li>



<li>The duration of the LLC (this can be perpetual)</li>



<li>The signature(s) of whoever submits the document</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">The state of Louisiana doesn’t give them a specific name, but many states call the individuals who sign and submit Articles of Organization “organizers.” For more information on organizers, visit our <a href="llc-organizer.html">LLC organizer information page</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The above list is the bare minimum that your Articles must contain. Louisiana law allows you to add more information to your Articles of Organization. And, depending on the nature of your LLC’s business, you might need to include other information.&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Information Needed for the Initial Report</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Along with your Articles of Organization, you’ll need to submit an Initial Report, which includes:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The legal name of your LLC</li>



<li>The street address of your registered office</li>



<li>The name of the registered agent</li>



<li>The names and municipal addresses (not post office boxes) of the first <a href="member-managed-vs-manager-managed-llc.html">managers or the members&nbsp;</a></li>



<li>The signature of everyone who signed the Articles of Organization</li>



<li>The signature of the registered agent</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you don’t have your first managers or members selected when the Initial Report and Articles of Organization are filed, you’ll need to later file a <a href="louisiana-supplemental-initial-report.html">Supplemental Report</a> listing their names and addresses.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The above list is the bare minimum of what your Articles of Organization must contain. Louisiana law allows you to add more information to your Articles of Organization. And depending on the nature of your LLC’s business, you might need to include other information.&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Information Needed for a Louisiana Initial Report</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">When you create an LLC in Louisiana, You have to file an Initial Report at the same time you file your Articles of Organization. An Initial Report must include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>The address (not just a P.O. box) of your LLC’s registered office</li>



<li>The name and address (not just a P.O. box) of each registered agent</li>



<li>A signed and notarized affidavit from each registered agent that states they accept the position</li>



<li>The names and addresses (not just P.O. boxes) of your managers or members</li>



<li>The signature(s) of whoever signed the Articles of Organization</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>How to Amend Your Articles of Organization</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You need only file your Articles of Organization once. But if any of the original Articles of Organization information needs to be updated, altered, or expanded, your business is required to inform the state about the changes.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You would report these changes by filing <a href="louisiana-llc-amendment.html">Louisiana Articles of Amendment</a> and paying a filing fee. If your Articles of Organization isn’t current, it could affect your ability to get a <a href="louisiana-certificate-good-standing.html">Louisiana Certificate of Good Standing</a>. A Louisiana LLC Certificate of Good Standing isn’t required to conduct business, but it can be important for business accounts, members, and potential investors. Basically, failing to keep your business up to date with state requirements can limit your LLC’s potential future growth.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Do you need help amending your Articles of Organization? We have an <a href="pricing-amendment.html">amendment filing service</a> that can handle it for you, as well as our <a href="pricing-worry-free.html">Worry-Free Compliance service</a>, which includes two amendment filings every year.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Keep your Louisiana LLC paperwork digitally organized</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If we help you file Articles of Organization, once the state approves your LLC, your paperwork will be available from your ZenBusiness dashboard. In the dashboard, you can keep this and other important paperwork digitally organized.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you get your physical paperwork back from the state approving your new LLC, you’ll want to keep it in a safe location along with your other important documents, such as your operating agreement, member certificates, contracts, compliance checklists, transfer ledger, legal documents, etc. We offer a customized business kit to help you keep these important documents organized and looking professional.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="create-a-louisiana-operating-agreement">Step 4:&nbsp;Create an operating agreement</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Write your own LLC operations rules in an operating agreement.</strong> Operating agreements outline the <strong>rules and procedures</strong> for the management of the LLC and establish <strong>ownership percentages, how profits are divided</strong> among members, and much more.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Louisiana law doesn’t legally require you to write an operating agreement, but it’s still considered an essential step in forming an LLC in Louisiana. However, you will have to conduct your business according to the state’s default rules if you don’t write an operating agreement. Louisiana’s default rules might not gel with your business needs, so it’s best to write as many of your own rules as you can.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Benefits of LA LLC Operating Agreements</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Writing a <a href="louisiana-operating-agreement.html">Louisiana operating agreement</a> is a way to maximize your control over your business. A comprehensive operating agreement can also provide the following benefits:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Sets clear expectations and boundaries for management of the business</li>



<li>Helps members and managers end conflicts peacefully by laying out detailed protocols for resolving disagreements</li>



<li>Establishes the percentage of ownership each member holds</li>



<li>Determines how profits will be divided among members</li>



<li>Puts in place procedures for admitting or removing LLC members</li>



<li>Sets clear rules about when you can and can’t dissolve the business</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Do I need an operating agreement even if I’m the only owner?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">It seems like most of the things in your operating agreement are intended to avoid disputes among the LLC members, so we understand why you might think a single-member LLC doesn’t need one. But potential investors, future business partners, and others may want to see your operating agreement regardless.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your operating agreement can also spell out what you want to happen to the business and its assets if you die or become incapacitated.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">One more thing: Occasionally, someone takes an LLC owner to court to try to prove that the owner and the LLC are the same entity so that they can go after the owner’s personal assets. If that happens, having an operating agreement in place is one more thing to further demonstrate to the court that the business owner and the LLC truly are separate.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What should I include in my LLC operating agreement?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can customize as much or as little about your business operations as you want in your operating agreement. However, you might want your agreement to address:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li><strong>Rules for accepting new members.</strong> Under the default rules, there must be unanimous, written consent from all LLC members before a new individual can become a member. If this is too stringent for your business, an operating agreement can change it.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Rules for sharing profits among members.</strong> Without a provision in your operating agreement, members have to share profits equally.</li>



<li><strong>Rules for how to manage the LLC.</strong> Your operating agreement can dictate what kind of powers and responsibilities each person in management will have.</li>



<li><strong>Rules for dissolving and winding up your LLC.</strong> With your operating agreement, you can identify specific events that will trigger the termination of your LLC. You can also spell out how the remaining assets will be divided.</li>
</ul>

<div class="wp-block-group has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="apply-for-an-ein-and-other-permits">Step 5:&nbsp;Apply for an EIN</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Prepare your LLC to pay its federal taxes by getting an Employer Identification Number (EIN).</strong> An EIN comes from the IRS, and it’s the identification number LLCs must use for paying their taxes at the federal level if they have more than one member, have employees, or are otherwise required to do so by the IRS.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Even if you run a single-member LLC without employees, having an EIN is likely in your best interest. Your EIN is like a Social Security number for your business. It prevents you from having to put your own Social Security number on tax and business filings and other paperwork, thus lowering your risk for identity theft. You’ll also likely need an EIN to open a business bank account.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Of course, obtaining your EIN involves filling out more paperwork, but that’s another task you can hand off to us. Our <a href="ein-number.html">Employer ID Number Service</a> quickly handles obtaining an EIN for your LLC so you can comply with your federal tax obligations.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Register for Louisiana business taxes</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">There’s a good chance your LLC will need to pay a number of local and state business taxes. Common state business taxes and fees include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Sales taxes</li>



<li>Unemployment insurance</li>



<li>Withholding taxes</li>
</ul>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can set up state tax account and unemployment insurance account numbers through the Louisiana geauxBIZ portal.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Can filing as an S corp lower my taxes?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">The LLC business structure gives you more flexibility than a corporation. One of those flexibilities is how you can choose to have your LLC taxed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The default tax status of an LLC is pass-through taxation. This appeals to most owners of LLCs because it avoids “double taxation,” in which a corporation pays taxes at both the business level and again when the income is paid to the individual owners. But some LLCs opt to be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation because, in their case, it works to their advantage.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Being taxed as a C corporation does mean you get double taxation, but, for certain LLCs, the pros can sometimes outweigh the cons. One benefit is that C corporations have the widest range of tax deductions, which could be an advantage in some scenarios, especially for more profitable LLCs. For example, employee health insurance premiums can be written off as a business expense.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">S corp is short for “Subchapter S Corporation” and is a tax status geared toward small businesses. Having your LLC taxed as an S corp has pass-through taxation like a standard LLC, but there’s another potential advantage for some LLCs: It could reduce your self-employment taxes.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Self-employment taxes are the portion of your taxes that pay for Social Security and Medicare. In a typical LLC, you would pay these on all of your profits.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">But filing as an S corp allows you to be an “employee-owner” and split your income into your salary and your share of the company’s profits. In this way, you pay employment taxes on your salary, but not self-employment taxes on your profits. (You’ll still pay the other applicable taxes on your LLC profits, of course.)</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The drawback is that the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizes S corps more closely, meaning you’re more likely to get audited. S corps also have more restrictions for qualifying.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">While it’s possible that one of the above options could work better for your LLC, remember that business taxes are very, very complicated. They’re also very specific to your situation. That’s why you truly need to consult a tax professional to see which taxing method works best for your Louisiana business.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you decide to form your LLC with an S corp status, our <a href="s-corporation.html">S corp service</a> can help you do that.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading txt-title-md zb-default-margin"><strong>Post-Formation Steps</strong></h2>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you’ve secured an EIN, you’ll be able to open a business bank account. Having separate accounts for your business and your personal banking is critical for sorting out your finances at tax time. It also helps you avoid commingling funds.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Commingling funds makes your taxes more difficult to sort out, and it could also be used against you if someone takes you to court to challenge whether you and your LLC are truly separate entities (i.e., they want to sue you for not just your business assets, but also your own assets).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You may also want to get business credit cards to make small purchases and start establishing your company’s credit score.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We offer a <a href="pricing-banking.html">discounted bank account</a> for your new business. This allows for unlimited transactions, online banking, a debit card, and more.

<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, an LLC still has the option of being taxed as a C corporation for federal income tax purposes. That may be advantageous to some larger LLCs because C corporations have the widest range of deductions.</span></p>
