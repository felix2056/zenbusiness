Additional costs may apply for expediting the filing and renewing licenses and permits. For the most recent filing fee schedule, it&#039;s recommended to check the Idaho Secretary of State website."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the benefits of an LLC in Idaho?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Forming an LLC in Idaho provides personal liability protection like a corporation and tax benefits like a partnership or sole proprietorship. LLCs in Idaho have straightforward filing, management, and compliance procedures. Idaho offers a top-performing economy with low costs of doing business and living, making it an attractive place to start a business. Various incentives, such as tax reimbursement, grants, financing, and workforce development, are available."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How are LLCs taxed in Idaho?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"LLCs in Idaho are typically treated as pass-through entities for both state and federal income taxes. Individual owners report business profits on their personal tax returns, and the LLC itself is not taxed as a separate entity. Larger LLCs may choose to be taxed as an S corporation or C corporation. Idaho has some unique business tax laws, so it&#039;s advisable to consult a tax professional to understand specific obligations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the processing time to form my Idaho LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Idaho Secretary of State typically processes LLC applications in 7 to 10 days. If filing by mail, additional time for delivery should be considered. Expedited processing is available at an extra cost, including same-day processing for a higher fee."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to file my operating agreement with the state of Idaho?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, Idaho does not require new LLCs to file their operating agreements with the state.

The LLC itself is not separately taxed. Larger LLCs may opt for S corporation or C corporation taxation. A tax professional can help determine the best tax classification for your specific business needs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Idaho allow a Series LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Idaho does not explicitly allow Series LLCs at this time. Business owners considering a Series LLC structure should consult with a lawyer to ensure compliance with state laws."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Idaho business licenses and permits do I need?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While Idaho doesn&#039;t have a general business license, businesses that sell or lease goods or services require a seller&#039;s permit (sales tax permit). Depending on your industry, location, and services offered, you may need other federal, state, and/or local licenses and permits, such as building permits or health permits. Research is necessary to determine specific requirements, or you can use a business license report service for assistance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to file an annual report for my Idaho LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, all LLCs in Idaho must file an annual report. There&#039;s no fee for filing the report, and it can be done online. Assistance with filing annual reports is available through various services."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I form a foreign LLC in Idaho?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To form a foreign LLC in Idaho, which is a business not based in the state but wants to operate there, you&#039;ll need to file a Foreign Registration Statement instead of the Certificate of Organization. The same fees apply, and you&#039;ll need an Idaho registered agent to maintain the foreign LLC."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I remove a member from an LLC in Idaho?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The process for removing a member from an LLC in Idaho should follow the rules established in the operating agreement."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a trade name be assigned to an LLC in Idaho?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, an LLC in Idaho can have a trade name, also known as an assumed name.

You&#039;ll also need to complete an Idaho LLC Statement of Dissolution and submit it to the appropriate authorities along with any required fees."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I transfer ownership of an LLC in Idaho?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Transferring ownership of an LLC in Idaho can be complex. The process will depend on the rules established in the operating agreement. Consulting a lawyer is advisable for assistance with the details of the ownership transfer."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need a business plan for my Idaho LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While a business plan is not legally required, having one is a wise choice.

<p class="txt-body-md">But even though setting up an LLC in Idaho has fewer administrative hurdles than a corporation, Idaho LLC registration still requires some patience and paperwork. If you’ve never started a business before, it can feel like white water rafting the Middle Fork of Salmon River without a paddle.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Enter ZenBusiness. In this article, we’ll show you how to start an LLC in Idaho. We’ll also show you how our business services can cut through the red tape for you so you can get to running the enjoyable parts of your business ASAP.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">One note before we start: This guide is only for standard, domestic (in-state) LLCs. If you want to start a foreign (out-of-state) LLC, an <a href="idaho-professional-limited-liability-company.html">Idaho professional limited liability company</a> (PLLC), or some other business entity, you may need to follow different steps that aren’t covered here. But if you’re ready to form a domestic LLC in Idaho, read on.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Creating an LLC in Idaho</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">To form an LLC in Idaho, you first need to <strong>choose a name</strong> for your business and <strong>appoint a registered agent</strong>. Then you must file your <strong>Certificate of Organization</strong> with the Idaho Secretary of State. This creates a public record of your company and allows the state to regulate and communicate with your business on important matters.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You have more basic steps to take even after your LLC becomes official. These include creating an Idaho LLC <strong>operating agreement</strong>, obtaining any necessary <strong>licenses and permits</strong>, and setting up your business to <strong>file taxes</strong> at the federal, state, and local levels.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Okay, here’s how to form an LLC in Idaho:</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Forming an Idaho LLC</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">To form an LLC in Idaho, you must file your Certificate of Organization with the Idaho Secretary of State. This creates a public record of your company and allows the state to regulate and communicate with your business on important matters.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Before you file the associated paperwork for starting an LLC in Idaho, you need to make some critical decisions. After filing the Certificate of Organization, there are additional steps you’ll need to take. This includes creating an Idaho LLC operating agreement, obtaining any necessary professional licenses, and setting up your business to file taxes at the federal, state, and local levels.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We’ve put together a step-by-step guide to simplify the process of forming an LLC in Idaho.</p>
</div></div>

<div style="height:24px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer has-focus-00-background-color zb-hide-on-desktop"></div>



<div class="wp-block-group has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="name-your-idaho-llc">Step 1:&nbsp;Name your Idaho LLC</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Choose a name for your Idaho LLC.</strong> Your initial consideration when choosing a name for your Idaho LLC is to make it unique from all other businesses in the state. Use our <a href="idaho-business-search.html">Idaho Business Entity Search page</a> to learn how to do a name check to verify the business name you want is available and not already in use.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The Idaho Secretary of State office advises you to contact them directly to see if the name you want is available before you file your Certificate of Formation. Their Idaho LLC search engine isn’t perfect.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">To comply with state naming requirements, an Idaho LLC’s name must end with a “designator” indicating its business type. You can choose from the words “Limited Liability Company” or “Limited Company” or the abbreviations “LC,” “L.C.,” “LLC,” or “L.L.C.” “Limited” may be abbreviated as “Ltd.,” and “company” may be abbreviated as “Co.”</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to the above, your LLC can’t contain language stating or implying that it’s a government agency. You also can’t state or imply that your company is organized for a purpose that isn’t legal.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Federal and Idaho State Trademarks</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Even if the Idaho Secretary of State approves your business name, that’s no guarantee that someone else hasn’t already claimed it with a federal or state trademark. To truly check to see if your business name is free of trademarks can be difficult because there’s no central place to check. Some businesses even employ an attorney specializing in trademarks to see if they’re in the clear.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can take some measures yourself, like searching the trademark database on the United States Patent and Trademark Office website. This can help you determine if someone’s already claimed a federal trademark on the name you want.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">State trademarks are applicable only within the borders of a state. The Idaho Secretary of State website has a trademark search engine where you can see if anyone has a state trademark on your desired LLC name. If you want, you can also apply for your own state trademark on the site.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to checking these databases, it’s wise to do an internet search for your business name, including checking domain names, social media sites, and even phone directories.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Check for available domain names</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">When coming up with a business name, it’s wise to consider securing a matching domain name for your future website. We have a tool to help you do a preliminary<a href="business-name-checker.html"> domain name search</a>. Our <a href="domain-registration.html">domain name registration service</a> can help you secure the online name that will best serve your company.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Is your Idaho LLC name available as a web domain?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Even if you don’t sell your products or services directly online, you’re going to want a presence on the web. After all, you want your company’s name, principal address, and contact info to appear when potential customers search for it.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">That’s why getting a good domain name that pairs well with your business name is so important. You’re likely going to be putting that URL on your business cards, signage, and other marketing materials, and you want people to be able to remember it and associate it with your business.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The ideal domain name for your company may already be taken, but you can still find others. In fact, if you find a truly great available domain name, it might be worth naming your business after that URL rather than the other way around.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can use our domain name search tool to see if your desired business name or something else that’s suitable is available as a URL. If you find such a domain name, you might want to lock it down before someone else does.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can also check to see what social media handles are available. Many businesses market on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, so getting the appropriate social media names can be important for effective online marketing.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We have a domain name service to help you find and purchase a domain name for your business. We can also help you create a <a href="webpage.html">business website</a> and provide <a href="get-domain.html">domain name privacy</a>.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Reserving a Business Name for an LLC in Idaho</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’re not ready to file your Certificate of Organization just yet, Idaho allows you to reserve a business name for four months for a fee. You may do this to make sure your chosen business name is still available in the Gem State when it’s time to file.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you’re filing your Certificate of Organization right away, you likely don’t need to file an Application for Reservation of Legal Entity Name. You can name your business when you file the Certificate of Organization. But you can still reserve the name if you’re worried that someone will snag it.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Filing a DBA in Idaho</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you plan on doing business under a name other than your official business name, you can file a Certificate of Assumed Business Name (commonly referred to as a DBA or “<a href="dba.html">doing business as</a>” name) after you register your business with the state of Idaho.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For example, this is helpful if you want to separate services under different titles or advertise under a name that doesn’t include the required “LLC” at the end. The state charges a small fee for a Certificate of Assumed Business Name.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You may also use our quick and easy <a href="idaho-dba.html">Idaho DBA service</a>, which can save you time, money, and potential headaches.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Name a registered agent.</strong> Idaho requires that an LLC have a registered agent for service of process. This means your Idaho LLC must have a person or entity that agrees to accept legal and official notices on your company’s behalf (for example, if the business is sued).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">An <a href="idaho-registered-agent.html">Idaho registered agent</a> must be an individual who is a resident of Idaho or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State’s office. It’s a requirement that they have a physical address in Idaho and agree to receive and forward legal notices to you. The address of the Idaho registered agent can’t be a P.O. box or something similar. It needs to be a physical street address so that the agent can receive notices in person.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Registered Agent Service</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">While you can be your own registered agent, it can cause problems, such as putting you in the awkward position of being notified of a lawsuit in front of customers. Hiring a professional <a href="registered-agent.html">registered agent service</a> like ours can provide the following benefits:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li>Avoiding embarrassing scenarios where you’re notified of a lawsuit in front of clients, employees, etc.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Ability to move your office location without having to update your registered agent address with the state.</li>



<li>Freedom to leave the office, as the Idaho registered agent must be present at the office during all normal business hours.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>What if a process server can’t find my Idaho registered agent?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Serving as your own registered agent or appointing a friend or family member to be your agent might seem the simplest way to meet the Idaho registered agent requirement. But consider what could happen if a process server is unable to find you or your appointed agent.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">This can occur if you or your appointee isn’t in the office (for example, meeting with a client, out of town, on vacation, etc.) when someone needs to reach the agent. It can also happen if the agent moves or quits and you forget to update your paperwork with the state.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">In addition to legal penalties for being out of compliance (including the possibility of the state dissolving your LLC and removing your limited liability status), failing to maintain a registered agent could mean that you won’t be notified of a lawsuit. A legal proceeding against you could actually go forward without your knowledge, meaning you wouldn’t even have a chance to defend yourself.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md">You can file the Certificate of Organization online or via paper; either method incurs a filing fee. To file online, you’ll need to create an Idaho SOSBiz account, which you can also use to file other forms.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Idaho has options for expediting your filing for an additional fee.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Filing by Mail with the Idaho Secretary of State</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Paper forms are mailed to the Office of the Secretary of State and must include payment in the form of a check. You can make checks out to the Idaho Secretary of State.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For those who choose to mail their Certificate of Organization, send all paperwork to:</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Office of the Secretary of State<br>450 N 4th Street<br>P.O. Box 83720<br>Boise, ID 83720-0080</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Online payment can be made with all major credit and debit cards for a small transaction fee.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin">Certificate of Organization Requirements</h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">To complete the Idaho LLC form, you’ll need to provide the following information:</p>


<ol class="txt-body-md">
<li>The name of your LLC</li>



<li>The street and mailing address of your LLC’s principal office</li>



<li>The name and street address of the company’s registered agent</li>



<li>The name and address of at least one “governor” of the LLC. Governor refers to a manager of a manager-managed LLC or a member of a member-managed LLC.</li>



<li>The mailing address where you would like to receive annual report notices</li>



<li>Contact information (phone number and email) where you can be reached</li>



<li>The name and signature of the <a href="llc-organizer.html">LLC organizer</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Digitally store your Idaho LLC paperwork</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you have us handle filing your Certificate of Organization, once the state approves your LLC, your paperwork will be available from your ZenBusiness dashboard, where you can keep it and other important paperwork digitally organized.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you get your physical paperwork back from the state approving your new LLC, you’ll want to keep it in a safe location along with your other important documents. These documents can include your formation documents, member certificates, legal documents, contracts, compliance checklists, transfer ledger, etc. We offer a customized business kit to help you keep these important documents organized and looking professional.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>How to Amend Your Certificate of Organization</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">You need only file your Certificate of Organization once. But if any information in the original Certificate of Organization needs to be updated, your business is required to inform the state about the changes.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You would report these changes by filing an <a href="idaho-llc-amendment.html">Amendment to the Idaho Certificate of Organization</a> and paying a filing fee. If your Certificate of Organization isn’t current, it could impact your ability to get an <a href="idaho-certificate-good-standing.html">Idaho Certificate of Good Standing</a>. This document isn’t required to conduct business, but it can be important for business accounts, potential investors, and expanding your business to other states. Basically, failing to keep your business up to date with state requirements can limit your LLC’s potential future growth.Do you need help amending your Certificate of Organization? We have an <a href="pricing-amendment.html">amendment filing service</a> that can handle it for you, as well as our <a href="pricing-worry-free.html">Worry-Free Compliance service</a>, which includes two amendment filings every year.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="create-an-idaho-operating-agreement">Step 4:&nbsp;Create an operating agreement</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Make an </strong><a href="idaho-operating-agreement.html"><strong>Idaho LLC operating agreement</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This document spells out the day-to-day operating procedures and details of your business. It covers things like who owns what percentage of the business, how profits are distributed, and how decisions are made.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Creating an LLC operating agreement helps set the ground rules between you and your partners before the business takes off. It helps you avoid disagreements and make clear decisions.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Benefits of an Operating Agreement</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">While having a comprehensive operating agreement isn’t a legal requirement for LLCs in Idaho, creating one is still considered an essential step in forming an LLC. The benefits include:</p>


<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li><strong>Additional personal asset protection:</strong> By spelling out which assets and affairs are tied to the business and not, you add another layer of legal protection between what happens to your business and what happens to you personally.</li>



<li><strong>Clearly defined rules:</strong> In the absence of an operating agreement, there are default rules set by the state of Idaho for how things work in an LLC. If you want to avoid the default and make it clear how your company should run, use an operating agreement.</li>



<li><strong>Assign ownership:</strong> The agreement can clearly spell out what percentage of the company each member owns. This includes how much capital they contributed and how any profits should be shared. This will help avoid any disagreements among the members down the road.</li>



<li><strong>Succession and dissolution:</strong> The agreement can include explicit details about who gets your share of the business if something happens. It can also include how things will be divided up if the business dissolves.</li>



<li><strong>Business funding:</strong> Sometimes, to get business loans or lines of credit, banks will want to see an operating agreement to make sure you’ve given your business serious thought.</li>



<li><strong>Mindset:</strong> Creating an operating agreement gets you in the right mindset to start a business. It forces you to think about different scenarios and plan accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Operating Agreement Templates</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Are you unsure as to how to create an operating agreement for your LLC? We offer a <a href="operating-agreement.html">guided customizable template</a> to help get you started. Our chatbot walks you through the process of creating your agreement and allows for e-signature of the document.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you’ve finalized your operating agreement and it’s time for all members to sign, you can have the signatures notarized. This secures the legal foundation of the agreement. However, you don’t need to file the finalized agreement with the Idaho Secretary of State or any other entity. You just need to keep it in a secure location with any other business-related documents.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md"></p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Do I need an operating agreement if I’m the only owner?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">It seems like most of the things in your operating agreement are intended to avoid disputes among the members, so you might think you don’t need one if your LLC has only one member. But potential investors, future business partners, and others may want to see your operating agreement regardless.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your operating agreement can also spell out what you want to happen to the business and its assets if you die or become incapacitated.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Here’s another consideration: On occasion, someone will take an LLC member to court to try to prove that the owner and the LLC are the same entity so that they can go after the owner’s personal assets. Should that happen, having an operating agreement in place is one more thing to further demonstrate to the court that the business owner and the LLC truly are separate.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group has-focus-10-background-color zb-rounded-container is-style-grid-full"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><h3 class="wp-block-heading title-underline txt-title-md-alt" id="idaho-apply-for-an-ein">Step 5:&nbsp;Apply for an EIN</h3>


<p class="txt-body-md"><strong>Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for the business.</strong> You’ll need an EIN, also referred to as a Tax ID Number or Federal Tax Identification Number, from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if you have more than one LLC member, hire employees, or meet certain other criteria. Most banks will also require an EIN for opening a business bank account.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">You can get your Idaho LLC’s EIN through the Internal Revenue Service website, by mail, or by fax. If you’re not fond of dealing with that particular government agency, we can get it for you. Our <a href="ein-number.html">EIN service</a> is quick and eliminates the hassle.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Register with the Idaho State Tax Commission</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Your company may need to register with the Idaho State Tax Commission. Whether your company needs to follow this step will depend on the exact taxes it will be collecting and/or has been collecting from the state and whether you have employees.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Visit the Idaho State Tax Commission Business Basics Hub webpage for information on how to register your business to pay taxes. It also explains what types of taxes you may need to pay to remain in good standing.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The Idaho Business Registration System website will assist you in registering with the Idaho Department of Labor, Tax Commission, and Industrial Commission to ensure you’re set up for any sales or use tax, income tax withholding, unemployment insurance, and more.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Open a business bank account for your Idaho LLC</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">Once you’ve secured an Employer Identification Number, you’ll be able to open a business bank account. Having separate accounts for your business activities and your personal banking is critical for sorting out your finances at tax time. It also helps you avoid commingling funds.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Commingling funds makes your taxes more difficult, and it could also be used against you if someone takes you to court to challenge whether you and your LLC are truly separate entities (that is, they want to go after your personal assets, not just the company’s).</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">We offer a <a href="pricing-banking.html">discounted bank account</a> for your new business. This allows for unlimited transactions, online banking, a debit card, and more. It may also be a good idea to get a business credit card so you can start developing a credit history.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">When you want to authorize others in your organization to use the business bank account, we offer a <a href="pricing-banking-resolution.html">banking resolution template</a> to simplify the process.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">For further help managing your new business’s finances, try <a href="money.html">ZenBusiness Money</a>. It can help you create invoices, receive payments, transfer money, and manage clients all in one place.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading txt-body-xl txt-bold zb-default-margin"><strong>Can filing as an S corp lower my taxes?</strong></h4>


<p class="txt-body-md">LLCs offer more flexibility than a corporation. One of those flexibilities is how you can choose to have your LLC taxed.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">By default, an LLC has pass-through taxation. This appeals to most LLC members because it avoids “double taxation,” in which a corporation pays taxes at both the business level and again when the income is paid to the individual owners. But some LLCs opt to be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation because, in their case, it works to their advantage.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Being taxed as a C corporation does mean you get double taxation, but, for some LLCs, the pros may outweigh the cons. One benefit is that C corporations have the widest range of tax deductions, which could be an advantage in some scenarios, especially for more profitable LLCs. For example, insurance premiums can be written off as a business expense.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">S corp is short for “Subchapter S Corporation” and is a tax status geared toward small businesses. Like a standard LLC, an S corp has pass-through taxation. But there’s another potential advantage for some LLCs: <strong>It could reduce your self-employment taxes.&nbsp;</strong></p>


<p class="txt-body-md">Self-employment taxes are the part of your taxes that pay for Social Security and Medicare. In a typical LLC, you would pay these on all of your profits.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">But filing as an S corp allows you to be an “employee-owner” and split your income into your salary and your share of the company’s profits. In this way, you pay employment taxes on your salary, but not self-employment taxes on your profits. (You’ll still pay the other applicable taxes on your LLC profits, of course.)</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">The drawback is that the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizes S corps more closely, meaning you’re more likely to get audited. S corps also have more restrictions for qualifying.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">While it’s possible that being taxed as a corporation could benefit your LLC, remember that business taxes are very complicated. They’re also very specific to your situation. That’s why you need to consult a tax professional to see which tax method would work best for your Idaho business and help with tax filings.</p>


<p class="txt-body-md">If you decide to form your LLC with an S corp status, our <a href="s-corporation.html">S corp service</a> can help you do that.</p>

<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Forming an LLC provides the personal liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a </span><a href="general-partnership-idaho.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> or sole proprietorship.

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is a more informal business structure with straightforward filing, management, compliance, regulations, and administration.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">There are also advantages to forming an LLC in Idaho compared to other states. Among these are:</span></p>
<ul class="txt-body-md">
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Idaho has a top-performing economy with one of the lowest costs of doing business.</span></li>

        <p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLCs are typically considered “pass-through entities,” meaning that the business itself typically doesn’t pay federal income tax on its profits. Instead, the responsibility to pay income taxes falls only on the individual. In a typical corporation, profits are taxed at both the business level and the individual owners’ level.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">In Idaho, LLCs are treated as pass-through entities for both state and federal income taxes. However, Idaho has some unusual business tax laws, so consult a tax professional to find out what your obligations are.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Single-member LLCs don’t have to file a separate federal return for their LLC. They report the LLC income on their personal income tax return (Form 1040). But LLCs with multiple members must file a separate information federal return for the LLC, Form 1065. Then each LLC member reports their share of the profits on Schedule K-1 and attaches it to their own personal federal taxes return.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although LLCs are taxed as sole proprietorships or general partnerships by default, LLCs also have the option to be taxed as corporations. Some LLC members choose to classify their businesses as an S corporation or a C corporation, which can be advantageous in some cases. In particular, many LLCs elect to be taxed as S corporations because it can save the members money on self-employment taxes. You can learn more on our </span><a href="what-is-an-s-corporation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What Is an S Corp?”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> page.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">You also have a few other forms of federal taxation to keep in mind. For example, you will likely need to pay self-employment taxes on your portion of the LLC’s profits. These are the taxes that go toward Social Security and Medicare. Fortunately, an LLC member can deduct half of the self-employment taxes paid as a business expense.</span></p>
<p class="txt-body-md"><span style="font-weight: 400">Your Idaho LLC may have to pay a wide variety of </span><a href="idaho-small-business-taxes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">other business taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. These include taxes that are payable to the Idaho government, like sales tax. If you have employees or sell certain items, additional taxes may apply. Among the taxes that you could be responsible for in the state of Idaho are the following:</span></p>
